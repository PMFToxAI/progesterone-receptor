The results show that both compounds act as selective progesterone receptor (PR) agonists but lack mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) activity. Molecular modelling using semiempirical AM1 and ab initio HF/6-31G** calculations, showed that the A-ring of the A-homo steroids may adopt five different conformations, although only three correspond to low energy conformers. The low energy conformers of each analogue were introduced into the ligand binding pocket of the PR ligand binding domain (LBD) obtained from the PR LBD-progesterone crystal structure. The steroid binding mode was then analyzed using 10 ns of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The PR LBD-progesterone complex was also simulated as a control system. The MD results showed that both A-homo steroids have one conformer that may be properly recognized by the PR, in agreement with the observed progestagen activity.

4,162448,Confirmatory,inhibition of [3h]r5020 binding to rabbit uterine progesterone receptor,"Title: Synthesis and evaluation of potential radioligands for the progesterone receptor._||_Abstract: Several steroidal analogues were synthesized as potential gamma-emitting radioligands for the progesterone receptor. Each of these compounds was tested as an inhibitor of the specific binding of [3H]-17 alpha,21-dimethyl-19-nor-4,9-pregnadiene-3,20-dione (R5020) to the progesterone receptor in rabbit uterine cytosol. R5020 is a well-known progestin with high affinity for the receptor. Of the compounds synthesized, aromatic N-substituted C-17 steroidal carboxamides inhibited the binding only poorly. Three compounds, 16 alpha-iodo-4-estren-17 beta-ol-3-one, 17 alpha-[2(E)-iodovinyl]-4-estren-17 beta-ol-3-one, and 17 alpha-[2(Z)-iodovinyl]-4-estren-17 beta-ol-3-one were excellent competitors, each having a Ki less than or equal to that of the natural progestin, progesterone. Since similar iodinated analogues of estrogens have been shown to be extremely stable both in vivo and in vitro, these compounds are potentially useful ligands for the progesterone receptor.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: J.

A series of progestin 16 alpha, 17 alpha-dioxolane ketals of acetophenone or substituted acetophenones that bind to the progesterone receptor (PgR) with comparable or higher affinities than the natural ligand, progesterone, have been prepared and evaluated as potential in vitro and in vivo probes for the progesterone receptor. p-Azidoacetophenone ketal 6, the tetrafluoro analog 8, and the p-(benzoyl)acetophenone ketal 9 demonstrate the required combination of high relative binding affinity (RBA) (6 = 15%, 8 = 14%, 9 = 6.6%, progesterone = 13%, R5020 = 100%) and photoinactivation efficiency (6 = 80%, 8 = 77%, 9 = 29% at 30 min) required for potential photoaffinity labeling reagents for the PgR. The synthesis of azide 6 has been modified to accommodate a palladium-catalyzed tritium gas hydrogenolysis of an iodoaryl precursor in the final stage of the synthetic sequence; this procedure has been verified by hydrogenation. In addition, the progestin p-fluoroacetophenone ketal 10 was selected for preparation in fluorine-18-labeled form, on the basis of its high affinity for the PgR (RBA = 53%). Fluorine-18-labeled progestins may be evaluated as potential diagnostic imaging agents for PgR-positive breast tumors. The radiochemical syntheses and further biochemical results with the fluorine-18-labeled ketal 10 and the tritium-labeled aryl azide 6 will be presented in an accompanying paper and elsewhere.",Journal: J.

For each quinoline, the levorotatory enantiomer was determined to be the more potent agonist of the human progesterone receptor isoform B (hPR-B) (EC50 < 3 nM), but the dextrorotatory enantiomers retained significant PR modulatory activity (EC50 < 200 nM). In two in vivo rodent models of progestational activity, a pregnancy maintenance assay and a uterine wet weight assay, the two eutomers displayed potent progesterone-like effects. In a third model for progestational activity, the mammary end bud assay, these compounds were significantly less active. These studies demonstrate that certain members of this class of selective progesterone receptor modulators display encouraging and potentially useful tissue-selective progestational effects.",Journal: J.

Estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER and PR) and their corresponding steroid hormones are critical for the relief of hot flashes and the treatment of patients who develop endometriosis, and these pathways can influence the development of endometrial, ovarian, and breast cancers. However, few studies have investigated or identified the natural product components in herbal supplements that act on the PR. In the current study, a new secoiridoid, demethoxy-cornuside (<b>1</b>), along with six known secoiridoids (<b>2</b>-<b>7</b>) were isolated from the twigs of dogwood (<i>Cornus officinalis</i>) by bioassay-guided isolation with a progesterone response element (PRE)/luciferase (Luc) reporter assay in Ishikawa cells.

In contrast to the cross-reactivity profiles observed with known steroidal antiprogestins, compounds of the general structural class described display a high degree of selectivity for the progesterone receptor and no functional activity on the glucocorticoid receptor.",Journal: J.

For each quinoline, the levorotatory enantiomer was determined to be the more potent agonist of the human progesterone receptor isoform B (hPR-B) (EC50 < 3 nM), but the dextrorotatory enantiomers retained significant PR modulatory activity (EC50 < 200 nM). In two in vivo rodent models of progestational activity, a pregnancy maintenance assay and a uterine wet weight assay, the two eutomers displayed potent progesterone-like effects. In a third model for progestational activity, the mammary end bud assay, these compounds were significantly less active. These studies demonstrate that certain members of this class of selective progesterone receptor modulators display encouraging and potentially useful tissue-selective progestational effects.",Journal: J.

Estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER and PR) and their corresponding steroid hormones are critical for the relief of hot flashes and the treatment of patients who develop endometriosis, and these pathways can influence the development of endometrial, ovarian, and breast cancers. However, few studies have investigated or identified the natural product components in herbal supplements that act on the PR. In the current study, a new secoiridoid, demethoxy-cornuside (<b>1</b>), along with six known secoiridoids (<b>2</b>-<b>7</b>) were isolated from the twigs of dogwood (<i>Cornus officinalis</i>) by bioassay-guided isolation with a progesterone response element (PRE)/luciferase (Luc) reporter assay in Ishikawa cells. Four phytoprogestins (<b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>) potentiated the effect of progesterone in the PRE/Luc assay.

In combination with a halogen (F or Cl) at C(9), replacement of the C(5) aryl group with variously substituted aryl groups resulted in optimization of the progestational activity, affording compounds with in vitro activity greater than that of progesterone as measured by a cotransfection assay using human progesterone receptor subtype-B (hPR-B). Binding affinities (Ki) to hPR-A were subnanomolar in many cases. These in vitro effects were verified in vivo using a rodent model.

Crystallographic analysis of PR ligand binding domain complexes clearly demonstrated that these moieties were accommodated by local shifts of the protein main chain and by adoption of alternative side chain rotamer conformations of ligand-proximal amino acids. These conformational changes imparted a ligand-specific volume to the binding pocket, from 490 A3 in the metribolone complex to 520 A3 in the norethindrone complex, 565 A3 in the progesterone complex, and 730 A3 in the mometasone furoate complex.

(red clover) is a popular botanical supplement used for women's health. Irilone isolated from red clover previously demonstrated progestogenic potentiation activity. In this study, irilone enhanced progesterone signaling was determined to not occur due to post-translational phosphorylation or by reducing progesterone receptor (PR) protein levels but instead increased PR protein levels in T47D breast cancer cells, which could be blocked by estrogen receptor (ER) antagonists, suggesting an ER dependent effect. Further, irilone increased luciferase activity from a hormone responsive element in a cell line that lacked ER and PR but expressed the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). A siRNA knockdown of GR in Ishikawa PR-B endometrial cancer cells reduced irilone's ability to enhance progesterone signaling. In an ovariectomized CD-1 mouse model, irilone did not induce uterine epithelial cell proliferation. The mechanism of action of irilone gives insight into PR crosstalk with other steroid hormone receptors, which can be important for understanding botanicals that are used for women's health.",Journal: J Nat Prod_||_Year: 2021_||_Volume: 84_||_Issue: 12.0_||_First Page: 3090_||_Last Page: 3099_||_DOI: 10.1021/acs.jnatprod.1c00835_||_Target ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL614649_||_ChEMBL Target Name: Ishikawa_||_ChEMBL Target Type: CELL-LINE - Target is a specific cell-line_||_Relationship Type: N - Non-molecular target assigned_||_Confidence: Target assigned is non-molecular,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4842168,20220830,20220830,5281779,312466910,,,,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,34813298,0,,,,7476.0,,1.0,,,Uterus,,unknown,Ishikawa,False,False,False,False
88,1815660,Confirmatory,competitive inhibition of progesterone receptor (unknown origin) by fluorescence polarization based competition assay,"Title: The Flavonoid Baicalein Negatively Regulates Progesterone Target Genes in the Uterus <i>in Vivo</i>._||_Abstract: Baicalein is a flavonoid extracted from the root of <i>Scutellaria baicalensis</i> (Chinese skullcap) and is consumed as part of this botanical dietary supplement to reduce oxidative stress, pain, and inflammation. We previously reported that baicalein can also modify receptor signaling through the progesterone receptor (PR) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) <i>in vitro</i>, which is interesting due to the well-established roles of both PR and GR in reducing inflammation. To understand the effects of baicalein on PR and GR signaling <i>in vivo</i> in the uterus, ovariectomized CD-1 mice were treated with DMSO, progesterone (P4), baicalein, P4 with baicalein, and P4 with RU486, a PR antagonist, for a week. The uteri were collected for histology and RNA sequencing. Our results showed that baicalein attenuated the antiproliferative effect of P4 on luminal epithelium as well as on the PR target genes HAND2 and ZBTB16. Baicalein did not change levels of PR or GR RNA or protein in the uterus. RNA sequencing data indicated that many transcripts significantly altered by baicalein were regulated in the opposite direction by P4. Similarly, a large portion of GO/KEGG terms and GSEA gene sets were altered in the opposite direction by baicalein as compared to P4 treatment. Treatment of baicalein did not change body weight, organ weight, or blood glucose level. In summary, baicalein functioned as a PR antagonist <i>in vivo</i> and therefore may oppose P4 action under certain conditions such as uterine hyperplasia, fibroids, and uterine cancers.",Journal: J Nat Prod_||_Year: 2022_||_Volume: 85_||_Issue: 1.0_||_First Page: 237_||_Last Page: 247_||_DOI: 10.1021/acs.jnatprod.1c01008_||_Target ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL208_||_ChEMBL Target Name: Progesterone receptor_||_ChEMBL Target Type: SINGLE PROTEIN - Target is a single protein chain_||_Relationship Type: D - Direct protein target assigned_||_Confidence: Direct single protein target assigned,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL5038160,20230314,20230314,5281605,103167026,5241,,P06401,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,34935393,0,,P06401,9606.0,,,1.0,,,,,antagonist,progesterone receptor,True,True,False,True

The ligand alignment generation, a critical part of model building, comprised two stages. First, thorough conformational sampling of docking poses within the PR binding pocket was made with the program GOLD. Second, a strategy to select representative poses for CoMSIA was developed utilizing the FlexX scoring function. After manual replacement of five poses where this approach had problems, a significant correlation (r(2) = 0.878) between the experimental affinities and electrostatic, hydrophobic, and hydrogen bond donor properties of the aligned ligands was found. Extensive model validation was made using random-group cross-validations, external test set predictions (r(pred)(2) = 0.833), and consistency check between the CoMSIA model and the PR binding site structure. Robustness, predictive ability, and automated alignment generation make the model a potential tool for virtual screening.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: J.

The steroids are 16 alpha, 17 alpha-fluoroacetophenone ketals of 16 alpha, 17 alpha-dihydroxyprogesterone and 16 alpha, 17 alpha, 21-trihydroxy-19-norprogesterone. Synthesis of the latter compound in seven steps from 19-norandrost-4-ene-3,17-dione is reported. Both compounds demonstrate high affinity for the progesterone receptor (PgR) (52.5 and 240%, respectively, relative to R5020 = 100). The syntheses were adapted to 18F-labeling with 4'-[18F]-fluoroacetophenone, prepared from 4'-nitroacetophenone by nucleophilic substitution with K18F/Kryptofix. Considerable adjustment of reaction conditions was required to effect ketalization using tracer quantities of the ketone. In tissue distribution studies in estrogen-primed immature female rats, both ketals showed selective uterine uptake, which was blocked by coinjection of a saturating dose of the unlabeled progestin ORG 2058. Additionally, metabolic stability of the radiolabel was indicated by the low radioactivity levels seen in bone. Both compounds showed relatively high uptake in fat, in accord with their relative lipophilicities demonstrated by HPLC-derived octanol-water partition coefficients.

SAR study demonstrated that the para-fluorinated substituents on the phenyl ring not only increased the potency for PR in a T47D cell functional assay, but also improved the selectivity over GR in an A549 cell functional assay. The para-fluorophenyl oxa-steroid 4l and the para-trifluoromethylphenyl oxa-steroid 4p were found to be remarkably more potent and more selective PR antagonists than mifepristone, with subnanomolar potency and about 140-fold selectivity over GR. Molecular modeling of the oxa-steroid bound to PR provided meaningful insight for the SAR study. oxa-Steroids 4a and 4b were found to be more efficacious than mifepristone in vivo in a rat uterine complement C3 assay via the oral route, although they were less than or equally potent to mifepristone in the T47D assay.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: Bioorg.

PR plays key roles in various physiological systems, including the female reproductive system, and PR antagonists are candidates for clinical treatment of multiple diseases, including uterine leiomyoma, endometriosis, breast cancer, and some psychiatric disorders.

The introduction of a 17alpha-pentafluorethyl side chain in the D-ring of the steroid skeleton allowed the combination of high antiprogestagenic activity with little or no other endocrinological effects. In contrast to many other antiprogestins, ZK 230211 did not convert to an agonist in the presence of protein kinase A (PKA) activators and showed high antiprogestagenic activity on both PR isoforms PR-A and PR-B. This high antiprogestagenic activity could also be demonstrated in several in vivo models. Furthermore, this compound displayed only marginal antiglucocorticoid effects. In tumor models ZK 230211 exhibited strong antiproliferative action. The pharmacological properties of ZK 230211 may prove useful in the treatment of endometriosis, leiomyomas, breast cancer, and in hormone replacement therapy.",Journal: J Med Chem_||_Year: 2000_||_Volume: 43_||_Issue: 26_||_First Page: 5010_||_Last Page: 5016_||_DOI: 10.1021/jm001000c_||_Target ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL208_||_ChEMBL Target Name: Progesterone receptor_||_ChEMBL Target Type: SINGLE PROTEIN - Target is a single protein chain_||_Relationship Type: D - Direct protein target assigned_||_Confidence: Direct single protein target assigned,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL749313,20100524,20230629,6918548,103390846,5241,In vitro,P06401,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,11150172,0,,P06401,9606.0,,,1.0,,,,,agonist,progesterone receptor,True,False,False,False

Radiochemical synthesis of these two species in high radiochemical purity and at high effective specific activity was accomplished by treatment of the corresponding diastereomerically pure 21-trifluoromethanesulfonates with fluorine-18 anion. In tissue biodistribution studies in estrogen-primed immature female Sprague-Dawley rats, both [18F]-endo-10a and [18F]endo-10b demonstrated high PR-selective uptake in the principal target tissues, the uterus and the ovaries, and relatively low uptake in fat and bone. The metabolism at the 21-position in these progestins (as monitored by in vivo defluorination) appears to be less than that in other 21-fluoroprogestins; this may reflect steric inhibition of metabolism at this site due to the bulk of the furan-substituted dioxolane ring at the 16 alpha, 17 alpha-position. Comparison with other fluorine-18-labeled progestins shows that the PR-specific uptake in uterine tissue correlates with the BSI of the ligand and that the fat uptake correlates with the NSB of the ligand at high levels of statistical significance.

For example, replacing the phenyl group of PR antagonists 2 and 3 with a 5'-cyanopyrrol-2'-yl moiety switched their functional activity to PR agonist activity (2a and 3a). These findings prompted us to examine if there is a similar effect of the 6-aryl moieties on the PR functional activity for the benzimidazolone template. Numerous analogs, such as 5, showed potent PR antagonist activity with about a 10-fold increase in potency as compared to those reported earlier in the same series. More interestingly, pyrrole-containing benzimidazolones 24-27 remained as PR antagonists in contrast to the PR agonist activity switch for oxindole and benzoxazinone scaffolds when a 5'-cyanopyrrol-2'-yl group was installed as a pendant aryl group.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: Bioorg.

Non-steroidal mimetics of mifepristone and progesterone are important templates for modulation of the progesterone receptor (PR). For our PR program, we sought an unexplored, synthetically accessible non-steroidal mimetic of mifepristone, suitable for parallel synthesis of analogues. Docking of compounds into a PR homology model identified 4-substituted pyrazolines, which, when synthesized and tested, exhibited functional antagonism of PR.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: Bioorg.

In a continuation of this work we examined the SAR of new 6-arylamino benzoxazinones and found the targets 1-25, with an extra amino linker between the pendent 6-aryl groups and benzoxazinone or benzoxazine-2-thione core, were PR antagonists. A series of compounds with substituents at the 1- and 4-positions as well as different 6-aryl groups were prepared and tested in the T47D cell alkaline phosphatase assay. Interestingly, the SAR unveiled from the 6-arylamino benzoxazinones was quite different from those of their parent compounds. For example, in contrast to the 6-aryl benzoxazinones, methyl substitution at the 1-position significantly increased the potency of 6-arylamino benzoxazinones. Several 6-arylamino benzoxazinones (e.g., 12, IC(50)=5.0 nM) had low nanomolar in vitro potency as PR antagonists in the T47D cell alkaline phosphatase assay.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: Bioorg.

SAR study demonstrated that the para-fluorinated substituents on the phenyl ring not only increased the potency for PR in a T47D cell functional assay, but also improved the selectivity over GR in an A549 cell functional assay. The para-fluorophenyl oxa-steroid 4l and the para-trifluoromethylphenyl oxa-steroid 4p were found to be remarkably more potent and more selective PR antagonists than mifepristone, with subnanomolar potency and about 140-fold selectivity over GR. Molecular modeling of the oxa-steroid bound to PR provided meaningful insight for the SAR study. oxa-Steroids 4a and 4b were found to be more efficacious than mifepristone in vivo in a rat uterine complement C3 assay via the oral route, although they were less than or equally potent to mifepristone in the T47D assay.",Journal: Bioorg.

However, their excellent therapeutic effects are often accompanied by undesirable side effects. To discover selective glucocorticoid receptor modulators (SGRMs) that preferentially induce transrepression with little or no transactivation activity, a structure-based virtual screening by combining molecular docking and InteractionGraphNet (IGN) rescoring was performed, and compound HP210 was identified. HP210 did not induce the transactivation functions of GR while still acted on the NF-κB mediated tethered transrepression function (IC<sub>50</sub> = 2.32 μM), and suppressed the secretion of pro-inflammation cytokines IL-1β and IL-6. Compared with dexamethasone, HP210 showed no cross activities with phylogenetically related mineralcorticoid receptor and progesterone receptor and no significant effect on osteoprotegerin, exhibiting a reduced side-effect profile. Then, guided by the molecular dynamics simulations and binding free energy calculations, compound HP210_b4 with over two-fold higher transrepression activity (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.99 μM) was discovered. This study reported a group of non-steroidal new-scaffold SGRMs, providing valuable clues for the development of novel anti-inflammatory drugs.",Journal: Eur J Med Chem_||_Year: 2022_||_Volume: 237_||_First Page: 114382_||_Last Page: 114382_||_DOI: 10.1016/j.ejmech.2022.114382_||_Target ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL208_||_ChEMBL Target Name: Progesterone receptor_||_ChEMBL Target Type: SINGLE PROTEIN - Target is a single protein chain_||_Relationship Type: D - Direct protein target assigned_||_Confidence: Direct single protein target assigned,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL5123340,20230629,20230629,5743|4362044,104234229|482082270,5241,,P06401,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,35483323,0,,P06401,9606.0,,,2.0,1.0,,,,agonist,progesterone receptor,True,False,False,False

Development of dual selective estrogen receptor modulators/VEGFR-2 inhibitors (SERMs/V-2I) has been an attractive strategy for the discovery of new breast cancer therapeutic agents. Our previous efforts led to the preparation of a series of 3-aryl-4-anilino-2H-chromen-2-ones endowed with potent estrogen receptor binding affinity and anti-proliferative efficacy. In this study, various structurally related 3-aryl-4-anilino/aryloxy-2H-chromen-2-one analogues were rationally designed, synthesized and evaluated as a new chemo-type of dual ERα and VEGFR-2 inhibitors. Most of the derivatives exhibited potent activities in both enzymatic and cellular assays. SAR investigation revealed that introducing of bioisosteric O atom at the C-4 position of coumarin scaffold is beneficial to improve the inhibitory potency, especially in ERα binding affinity assay. Furthermore, most of the piperidyl substituted compounds showed better inhibitory activity against MCF-7 and Ishikawa cells than lead compounds BL-18d, tamoxifen and Vandetanib. Optimization of the hit compound, identified in an ERα binding affinity assay, led to compound 42d, exhibiting an IC50 for ERα binding affinity of 2.19 μM while retaining an excellent inhibition on VGFR-2 as well as a potent suppression on the growth of angiogenesis-related cells. In RT-PCR assay, 42d exerted significantly antiestrogenic property via suppressing the expression of progesterone receptor (PgR) mRNA in MCF-7 cells, which was consistent with the ERα antagonistic property of a selective estrogen receptor modulator. Further mechanism investigation demonstrated that compound 42d could inhibit the activation of VEGFR-2 and subsequent signaling transduction of Raf-1/MAPK/ERK pathway in MCF-7 cells. All these results together with molecular modeling studies open a new avenue for the development of multifunctional agents targeting ERα and VEGFR-2 in the therapy of some breast cancers.",Journal: Eur J Med Chem_||_Year: 2017_||_Volume: 140_||_First Page: 252_||_Last Page: 273_||_DOI: 10.1016/j.ejmech.2017.09.015_||_Target ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL206_||_ChEMBL Target Name: Estrogen receptor alpha_||_ChEMBL Target Type: SINGLE PROTEIN - Target is a single protein chain_||_Relationship Type: D - Direct protein target assigned_||_Confidence: Direct single protein target assigned,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4134021,20200623,20220318,2733526|145953908,103170100|404658354,2099,,P03372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,28942113,0,,P03372,9606.0,,,2.0,2.0,,,,antagonist,Estrogen receptor,False,False,True,False

Optimization departed from the previously described pyrazoline 3a and focused on improving the selectivity for MR versus the progesterone receptor (PR) as an approach to avoid potential sex-hormone-related adverse effects and improving biopharmaceutical properties. From this effort, (R)-14c was identified as a potent nonsteroidal MR antagonist (IC50 = 4.5 nM) with higher than 500-fold selectivity versus PR and other related nuclear hormone receptors, with improved solubility as compared to 2 and pharmacokinetic properties suitable for oral administration. (R)-14c was evaluated in vivo using the increase of urinary Na(+)/K(+) ratio in rat as a mechanism biomarker of MR antagonism. Treatment with (R)-14c by oral administration resulted in significant increases in urinary Na(+)/K(+) ratio and demonstrated this novel compound acts as an MR antagonist.",Journal: J. Med.

Here a series of 2, 4-disubstituted pyrimidine derivatives were designed, synthesized and evaluated as dual ERα/VEGFR-2 ligands. Most of the derivatives exhibited potent activities in both enzymatic and cellular assays. Structure-activity relationship studies showed that a hydrogen-bonding interaction in the head section is important factors for the enhancement of ERα-binding affinity. The most potent compound II-9OH, an analog of 2-(4-hydroxylphenyl)pyrimidine, was 19-fold more efficacious than tamoxifen in MCF-7 cancer cells and exhibited the best ERα binding affinity (IC50 = 1.64 μM) as well as excellent VEGFR-2 inhibition (IC50 = 0.085 μM). Furthermore, this dual targeted compound II-9OH exerted significantly antiestrogenic property via suppressing the expression of progesterone receptor (PgR) mRNA in MCF-7 cells and also showed obvious in vivo angiogenesis inhibitory effects in CAM assay. An induction of apoptosis and a decrease in cell migration, accompanied by transduction inhibition of Raf-1/MAPK/ERK pathway, were observed in MCF-7 cells after treatment with II-9OH, suggesting that II-9OH is a promising candidate for the development of multifunctional agents targeting ERα and VEGFR-2 in the therapy of some breast cancers.",Journal: Eur J Med Chem_||_Year: 2018_||_Volume: 150_||_First Page: 783_||_Last Page: 795_||_DOI: 10.1016/j.ejmech.2018.03.018_||_Target ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL206_||_ChEMBL Target Name: Estrogen receptor alpha_||_ChEMBL Target Type: SINGLE PROTEIN - Target is a single protein chain_||_Relationship Type: D - Direct protein target assigned_||_Confidence: Direct single protein target assigned,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4231549,20200619,20220318,145985090,404704506,2099,,P03372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,29587221,0,,P03372,9606.0,,,1.0,1.0,,,,antagonist,Estrogen receptor,False,False,True,False

The structures of the isolated compounds were determined on the basis of one- and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy and high-resolution mass spectrometry as well as by comparison with the literature. All compounds were tested for their activity towards the Hsp90 chaperoning machine in vitro using the progesterone receptor (PR) and rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL). Among the isolated compounds, only sclerotiorin efficiently inhibited the Hsp90 machine chaperoning activity. However, sclerotiorin showed no cytotoxic effect on breast cancer Hs578T, MDA-MB-231 and prostate cancer LNCaP cell lines. Interestingly, deacetylation of sclerotiorin increased its cytotoxicity toward the tested cell lines over a period of 48 h.",Journal: Bioorg. Med.

328,162449,Literature-derived,relative binding affinity for progesterone receptor,"Title: Additional conformational data for the mapping of the progestin binding site: crystal structures of 21-(phenylseleno)progesterone and 17 alpha-(phenylseleno)progesterone._||_Abstract: The crystal structures of 21-(phenylseleno)progesterone (1), which binds with moderate affinity to the progestin receptor, and 17 alpha-(phenylseleno)progesterone (2), which binds hardly at all, have been studied in an attempt to explain these differences in affinity and to obtain further information on the location of the progestin receptor binding site with respect to the progesterone molecule. The crystal structures were refined by isotropic thermal approximation to R values of 0.082 for 1 and 0.084 for 2. The unusual 17 beta side-chain orientation of 2 with a C16-C17-C20-O20 torsion angle of +13 degrees compared to -7 degrees for progesterone would seem to preclude hydrogen bonding with the progestin receptor binding site and provides strong supporting evidence for the contention that this site is located above the beta face of the molecule. Any rotation of the C21 methyl group into a more appropriate position is furthermore impeded by the presence of the 17 alpha-phenylseleno substituent. On the other hand, some hydrogen bonding can occur in the case of 1 (C16-C17-C20-O20 = 31 degrees) despite the fact that the difference in torsion angle (24 degrees) with respect to progesterone is, in absolute values, greater than that for 2 (20 degrees). This is because the orientation of the 17 beta-acetyl side chain of 1 is directed above the beta face closer to the progestin binding site, as previously defined on the basis of data on a large number of molecules, and because the 21-phenylseleno substituent constitutes only limited steric hindrance to binding. Thus, the difference in affinity of these two compounds is entirely consistent with observations that the H-bond donor is located toward O20 in the beta region of C16.",Journal: J. Med.

The 13 beta,16 beta bridge was constructed by intramolecular alkylation of the C-16 enolate anion from 3-methoxy-13 beta-[3'-(tosyloxy)propyl]gona-3,5-dien-17-one, the latter being obtained via Birch reduction of both aryl groups of 17 beta-hydroxy-3-methoxy-13 beta-(3'-phenoxypropyl)gona-1,3,5(10),8-tetraene (1). The 11 beta,13 beta bridge was constructed by Prins cyclization of 17 beta-acetoxy-3-methoxy-13 beta-(3'-oxopropyl)gona-1,3,5(10),9(11)-tetraene, itself obtained via Birch reduction of only the side-chain aryl group of 1. Binding affinities of certain of these compounds and substituted 13 beta-propyl derivatives of 17 alpha-ethynyl-17 beta-hydroxygon-4-en-3-one for the uterine cytosol receptor of progesterone are reported, and the origin of the high progestational activity of norgestrel and 11 beta-substituted progestins is discussed.",Journal: J.

371,162435,Literature-derived,relative binding affinity for progesterone receptor(pgr) in human t47d cells,"Title: A potential radioiodinated ligand for androgen receptor: 7 alpha-methyl-17 alpha-(2'-(E)-iodovinyl)-19-nortestosterone._||_Abstract: The presence of androgen receptor (AR) in prostate cancer has been linked to the androgen-dependent nature of the tumor and has also been shown to have prognostic significance; it also appears to be a positive prognostic indicator in breast cancer. However, due to the relatively low AR concentrations in most tumors and the inherently low specific activity of tritium, the assay of AR based on available 3H-ligands is not sensitive enough to measure accurately the amount of receptor in small specimens. A 125I-ligand like those available for the estrogen and progesterone receptors would be helpful, but development of such a ligand for AR has not been very successful. Although several androgen analogues containing iodine, bromine, or selenium have been synthesized specifically as potential probes for AR, none have shown any significant affinity or specificity for the receptor. We therefore undertook the synthesis of new potential AR ligands which could be radioiodinated, and determined their affinities for AR (from rat uterus and MCF-7 human breast cancer cells) by using a competition assay. We have examined both 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone (5 alpha-DHT) and 19-nortestosterone analogues and have identified two such compounds which showed high AR affinity: (17 alpha,20E)-17 beta-hydroxy-21-iodo-5 alpha-pregn-20-en-3-one (17 alpha-[E)-iodovinyl)-5 alpha-DHT, 9) and 17 beta-hydroxy-7 alpha-methyl-(17 alpha,20E)-21-iodo-19-norpregna-4,20-dien-3- one (7 alpha-methyl-17 alpha-[E)-iodovinyl)-19-nortestosterone, 11). In fact, the affinity of the latter for human AR was found to be superior to that of 5 alpha-DHT itself. These iodovinyl analogues could be easily prepared in the radioiodinated form, and should prove to be extremely useful in assaying low levels of AR in small specimens.",Journal: J. Med.

Potential agents for imaging prostatic cancer by positron emission tomography._||_Abstract: We have prepared nine androgens substituted with fluorine at C-16 or C-20 to evaluate their potential, as positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging agents for prostatic cancer when labeled with the positron emitting radionuclide fluorine-18 (t1/2 = 110 min). These compounds represent members from the following classes of androgens: testosterone (T), 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), 7 alpha-methyl-19-nortestosterone (MNT), mibolerone (Mib), and metribolone (R1881). All of these compounds were prepared by functionalization of suitable androgen precursors, and the synthetic routes were developed to allow the introduction of fluorine by a fluoride ion displacement reaction late in the synthesis, as is required for the preparation of these compounds in fluorine-18 labeled form. We have also prepared four androgens in which the C-3 carbonyl or 17 beta-hydroxyl groups are replaced by fluorine. Most of the fluorine-substituted androgens show high affinity for the androgen receptor (AR), although fluorine substitution lowers their affinity by a small factor. None of the androgens where fluorine replaces oxygen functions at C-3 or C-17 have substantial affinity for AR. Derivatives of the natural androgens (T and DHT) as well as MNT have little affinity for other steroid hormone receptors (progesterone and mineralocorticoid receptors), whereas the Mib and R1881 derivatives have somewhat greater heterologous binding. With sex steroid binding protein, a human serum binding protein, the pattern of binding affinities is nearly the reverse, with derivatives of Mib, R1881 and MNT having low affinity, and DHT and T, high affinity. From these fluorine-substituted compounds, we can select several whose preparation in fluorine-18 labeled form for further tissue distribution studies is merited.",Journal: J. Med.

However, their use is limited by target related adverse effects on, e.g., glucose homeostasis and bone metabolism. Starting from a nonsteroidal GR ligand (4) that is a full agonist in reporter gene assays, we exploited key functional triggers within the receptor, generating a range of structurally diverse partial agonists. Of these, only a narrow subset exhibited full anti-inflammatory efficacy and a significantly reduced impact on adverse effect markers in human cell assays compared to prednisolone. This led to the discovery of AZD9567 (15) with excellent in vivo efficacy when dosed orally in a rat model of joint inflammation. Compound 15 is currently being evaluated in clinical trials comparing the efficacy and side effect markers with those of prednisolone.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: J Med Chem_||_Year: 2018_||_Volume: 61_||_Issue: 5_||_First Page: 1785_||_Last Page: 1799_||_DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01690_||_Target ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL208_||_ChEMBL Target Name: Progesterone receptor_||_ChEMBL Target Type: SINGLE PROTEIN - Target is a single protein chain_||_Relationship Type: D - Direct protein target assigned_||_Confidence: Direct single protein target assigned,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4194582,20200618,20220830,5755|121248172,103189031|404691221,5241,,P06401,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,29424542,0,,P06401,9606.0,,,2.0,1.0,,,,unknown,progesterone receptor,True,True,False,True

We recently identified the indanylacetic acid moiety as a well-tunable PPAR agonist head group. Here we report the synthesis and structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies of novel aryl tail group derivatives that led to a new class of potent PPAR pan agonists. While most of the tail group modifications imparted potent PPAR delta agonist activity, improvement of PPAR alpha and gamma activity required the introduction of new heterocyclic substituents that were not known in the PPAR literature. Systematic optimization led to the discovery of 4-thiazolyl-phenyl derivatives with potent PPAR alpha/gamma/delta pan agonistic activity. The lead candidate from this series was found to exhibit excellent ADME properties and superior therapeutic potential compared to known PPAR gamma activating agents by favorably modulating lipid levels in hApoA1 mice and hyperlipidemic hamsters, while normalizing glucose levels in diabetic rodent models.",Journal: J.

These compounds were partial agonists in transactivation assays when compared to 1 (T0901317) and were slightly weaker with respect to potency and efficacy on LXRalpha than on LXRbeta. Lead compounds in this series 12 (WAY-252623) and 13 (WAY-214950) showed less lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells than potent full agonists 1 and 3 (WAY-254011) but were comparable in efficacy to 1 and 3 with respect to cholesterol efflux in THP-1 foam cells, albeit weaker in potency. Compound 13 reduced aortic lesion area in LDLR knockout mice equivalently to 3 or positive control 2 (GW3965). In a 7-day hamster model, compound 13 showed a lesser propensity for plasma TG elevation than 3, when the compounds were compared at doses in which they elevated ABCA1 and ABCG1 gene expression in duodenum and liver at equal levels. In contrast to results previously published for 2, the lack of TG effect of 13 correlated with its inability to increase liver fatty acid synthase (FAS) gene expression, which was up-regulated 4-fold by 3. These results suggest indazoles such as 13 may have an improved profile for potential use as a therapeutic agent.",Journal: J. Med.

Syntheses, steroid hormone receptor binding affinities, and cytostatic activity._||_Abstract: A number of acetoxy-substituted 5,6-dihydroindolo[2,1-a]isoquinolines were synthesized and tested for binding affinity for steroid hormone receptors. All of the derivatives bind to the estrogen receptor with RBA values ranging from 1.5 to 17 (17 beta-estradiol = 100). Some of them show binding affinities for the androgen receptor as well. In the mouse uterine weight test, the tetracycles proved to be weak estrogens with partial antagonistic activity. All of the compounds were tested in vitro for cytostatic activity with hormone-independent MDA-MB 231 and hormone-dependent MCF-7 breast cancer cells. A cytostatic effect was found in both cell lines. The comparison of results exhibited a stronger inhibitory effect on MCF-7 cells only for compounds with high binding affinity for the estrogen receptor. For those derivatives, it can be assumed that the growth inhibition is partly mediated by the estrogen receptor.",Journal: J. Med.

In the liver glucocorticoid receptor antagonism suppresses hepatic glucose production decreasing plasma glucose levels; however, extrahepatic antagonism produces several undesirable side effects including activation of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis. A series of nonsteroidal passive N-(3-dibenzylamino-2-alkyl-phenyl)-methanesulfonamide glucocorticoid receptor modulators was discovered. Liver selective and systemically available members of this series were found and characterized in diabetes and side effect rodent models. A highly liver selective member of this series, acid 14, shows efficacy in the ob/ob model of diabetes. It lowers plasma glucose, cholesterol, and free fatty acid concentrations and reduces the rate of body weight gain. The structurally related systemically available passive modulator 12 lowers glucose, HbA(1c), triglyceride, free fatty acid, and cholesterol levels. Interestingly, it did not acutely activate the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis in unstressed CD-1 mice or have the abortive effects observed with 1.

411,39328,Literature-derived,relative affinity for rat androgen receptor(ar) and progesterone receptor(pgr),"Title: Synthesis of high affinity fluorine-substituted ligands for the androgen receptor. Potential agents for imaging prostatic cancer by positron emission tomography._||_Abstract: We have prepared nine androgens substituted with fluorine at C-16 or C-20 to evaluate their potential, as positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging agents for prostatic cancer when labeled with the positron emitting radionuclide fluorine-18 (t1/2 = 110 min). These compounds represent members from the following classes of androgens: testosterone (T), 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), 7 alpha-methyl-19-nortestosterone (MNT), mibolerone (Mib), and metribolone (R1881). All of these compounds were prepared by functionalization of suitable androgen precursors, and the synthetic routes were developed to allow the introduction of fluorine by a fluoride ion displacement reaction late in the synthesis, as is required for the preparation of these compounds in fluorine-18 labeled form. We have also prepared four androgens in which the C-3 carbonyl or 17 beta-hydroxyl groups are replaced by fluorine. Most of the fluorine-substituted androgens show high affinity for the androgen receptor (AR), although fluorine substitution lowers their affinity by a small factor. None of the androgens where fluorine replaces oxygen functions at C-3 or C-17 have substantial affinity for AR. Derivatives of the natural androgens (T and DHT) as well as MNT have little affinity for other steroid hormone receptors (progesterone and mineralocorticoid receptors), whereas the Mib and R1881 derivatives have somewhat greater heterologous binding. With sex steroid binding protein, a human serum binding protein, the pattern of binding affinities is nearly the reverse, with derivatives of Mib, R1881 and MNT having low affinity, and DHT and T, high affinity. From these fluorine-substituted compounds, we can select several whose preparation in fluorine-18 labeled form for further tissue distribution studies is merited.",Journal: J. Med.

Preliminary structure-activity relationships were focused on substitution at C-1 and indicated a preference for 3-, 4-, and 5-substituted aromatic and benzylic groups. The resulting analogues, e.g., 18 and 34, exhibited excellent affinity for hGR (IC(50) 1.9 nM and 2.8 nM, respectively) and an interesting partial agonist profile in functional assays of transactivation (tyrosine aminotransferase, TAT, and glutamine synthetase, GS) and transrepression (IL-6). The most potent compounds described in this study were the tertiary alcohol derivatives 21 and 25. These candidates showed highly efficacious IL-6 inhibition versus dexamethasone. The thiophenyl analogue 25 was evaluated in vivo in the mouse LPS challenge model and showed an ED(50) = 4.0 mg/kg, compared to 0.5 mg/kg for prednisolone in the same assay.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: J.

Compound 10, the archetype of a new family of dibenzoxepane and dibenzosuberane sulfonamides, is a potent anti-inflammatory agent with selectivity for the GR versus other steroid receptors and a differentiated gene expression profile versus clinical glucocorticoids (lower GR transactivation with comparable transrepression). A stereospecific synthesis of this chiral molecule provides the unique topology needed for biological activity and structural biology. In vivo activity of 10 in acute and chronic models of inflammation is equivalent to prednisolone. The crystal structure of compound 10 within the GR ligand binding domain (LBD) unveils a novel binding conformation distinct from the classic model adopted by cognate ligands. The overall conformation of the GR LBD/10 complex provides a new basis for binding, selectivity, and anti-inflammatory activity and a path for further insights into structure-based ligand design.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: J.

As resistance to clinically used anti-AR drugs remains a major challenge for the treatment of advanced PCa, there is a pressing need for new anti-AR therapeutic avenues. In this study, we identified a binding site on the DNA binding domain (DBD) of the receptor and utilized virtual screening to discover a set of micromolar hits for the target. Through further exploration of the most potent hit (1), a structural analogue (6) was identified demonstrating 10-fold improved anti-AR potency. Further optimization resulted in a more potent synthetic analogue (25) with anti-AR potency comparable to a newly FDA-approved drug Enzalutamide. Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that the developed inhibitors do interact with the intended target site. Importantly, the AR DBD inhibitors could effectively inhibit the growth of Enzalutamide-resistant cells as well as block the transcriptional activity of constitutively active AR splice variants, such as V7.",Journal: J.

This series of AR antagonists is structurally characterized by a linear tricyclic 1,2-dihydropyridono[5,6-g]quinoline core. Analogues inhibit AR-mediated reporter gene expression and bind to AR as potently as or better than any known AR antagonists. Several analogues also showed excellent in vivo activity in classic rodent models of AR antagonism, inhibiting growth of rat ventral prostate and seminal vesicles, without accompanying increases in serum gonadotropin and testosterone levels, as is seen with other AR antagonists. Investigations of structure-activity relationships surrounding this pharmacophore resulted in molecules with complete specificity for AR, antagonist activity on an AR mutant commonly observed in prostate cancer patients, and improved in vivo efficacy.

This series of AR antagonists is structurally characterized by a linear tricyclic 1,2-dihydropyridono[5,6-g]quinoline core. Analogues inhibit AR-mediated reporter gene expression and bind to AR as potently as or better than any known AR antagonists. Several analogues also showed excellent in vivo activity in classic rodent models of AR antagonism, inhibiting growth of rat ventral prostate and seminal vesicles, without accompanying increases in serum gonadotropin and testosterone levels, as is seen with other AR antagonists. Investigations of structure-activity relationships surrounding this pharmacophore resulted in molecules with complete specificity for AR, antagonist activity on an AR mutant commonly observed in prostate cancer patients, and improved in vivo efficacy. Molecules based on this series of compounds have the potential to provide unique and effective clinical opportunities for treatment of prostate cancer and other androgen-dependent diseases.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: J.

This paper describes the effect of replacing the trifluoromethyl group on binding and agonist activity of the GR ligand 1. The results illustrate that replacing the CF3 group with a cyclohexylmethyl or benzyl group maintains the GR binding potency. These substitutions alter the functional behavior of the GR ligands from agonists to antagonists. Docking studies suggest that the benzyl analog 19 binds in a similar fashion as the GR antagonist, RU486. The central benzyl group of 19 and the C-11 dimethylaniline moiety of RU486 overlay. Binding of compound 19 is believed to force helix 12 to adopt an open conformation and this leads to the antagonist properties of the non-CF3 ligands carrying a large group at the center of the molecule.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: Bioorg.

Various dibenzoxazepine moieties were also prepared in an effort to replace a known dibenzoxepane system which interacts with the hydrophobic region of the MR LBD. In addition, an X-ray crystal structure was obtained from a highly potent compound which was shown to exhibit both partial agonist and antagonist modes of action against MR.",Journal: Bioorg. Med.

It is activated by the steroid hormone progesterone. Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and their interactions with steroid hormone receptors like PR causes disruption of normal endocrine function. To identify the compounds that activate PR signaling, a PR-UAS-bla GripTite cell line i.e. PR-UAS-bla HEK 293T (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) containing a beta-lactamase reporter gene under the control of an Upstream Activator Sequence (UAS) was used to screen Tox21 10K compound library.","Disclaimer:_||_Although all reasonable efforts have been made to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data, caution should be exercised when interpreting the results as artifacts are possible from nonspecific effects such as assay signal interference. The curve fitting and activity calls presented here are based on the NCATS analysis methods. Alternative analysis methods and interpretations of the data are available at EPA (http://actor.epa.gov) and NTP (http://tools.niehs.nih.gov/cebs3/ui/)._||_Compound Ranking:_||_1. Compounds are first classified as having full titration curves, partial modulation, partial curve (weaker actives), single point activity (at highest concentration only), or inactive. See data field 'Curve Description'. For this assay, apparent activators are ranked higher than compounds that showed apparent inhibition._||_2. For all inactive compounds, PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE is 0. For all active compounds, a score range was given for each curve class type given above.  Active compounds have PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE between 40 and 100.  Inconclusive compounds have PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE between 1 and 39.

487,1346795,Confirmatory,qhts assay to identify small molecule antagonists of the progesterone receptor (pr) signaling pathway,"U.S. Tox21 Program_||_National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences [NCATS]_||_NIH Chemical Genomics Center [NCGC]_||_U.S. Environmental Protection Agency [EPA]_||_National Institutes of Environmental Health Sciences [NIEHS]_||_National Toxicology Program [NTP]_||_U.S. Food and Drug Administration [FDA]_||_Tox21 Assay Overview:_||_Progesterone receptor (PR), a nuclear hormone receptor, plays an important role in development, metabolic homeostasis and reproduction. It is activated by the steroid hormone progesterone. Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and their interactions with steroid hormone receptors like PR causes disruption of normal endocrine function. To identify the compounds that inhibit PR signaling, a PR-UAS-bla GripTite cell line i.e. PR-UAS-bla HEK293T (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) containing a beta-lactamase reporter gene under the control of an Upstream Activator Sequence (UAS) was used to screen Tox21 10K compound library.","Disclaimer:_||_Although all reasonable efforts have been made to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data, caution should be exercised when interpreting the results as artifacts are possible from nonspecific effects such as assay signal interference. The curve fitting and activity calls presented here are based on the NCATS analysis methods. Alternative analysis methods and interpretations of the data are available at EPA (http://actor.epa.gov) and NTP (http://tools.niehs.nih.gov/cebs3/ui/)._||_Compound Ranking:_||_1. Compounds are first classified as having full titration curves, partial modulation, partial curve (weaker actives), single point activity (at highest concentration only), or inactive. See data field 'Curve Description'. For this assay, apparent inhibitors are ranked higher than compounds that showed apparent activation._||_2. For all inactive compounds, PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE is 0. For all active compounds, a score range was given for each curve class type given above.

488,1346798,Confirmatory,qhts assay to identify small molecule antagonists of the progesterone receptor (pr) signaling pathway - cell viability counter screen,"U.S. Tox21 Program_||_National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences [NCATS]_||_NIH Chemical Genomics Center [NCGC]_||_U.S. Environmental Protection Agency [EPA]_||_National Institutes of Environmental Health Sciences [NIEHS]_||_National Toxicology Program [NTP]_||_U.S. Food and Drug Administration [FDA]_||_Tox21 Assay Overview:_||_Progesterone receptor (PR), a nuclear hormone receptor, plays an important role in development, metabolic homeostasis and reproduction. It is activated by the steroid hormone progesterone. Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and their interactions with steroid hormone receptors like PR causes disruption of normal endocrine function. To identify the compounds that inhibit PR signaling, a PR-UAS-bla GripTite cell line i.e. PR-UAS-bla HEK293T (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) containing a beta-lactamase reporter gene under the control of an UAS response element was used to screen Tox21 10K compound library. The cytotoxicity of the Tox21 compound library against the PR-bla cell line was tested in parallel by measuring the cell viability using CellTiter-Glo assay in the same wells.","Disclaimer:_||_Although all reasonable efforts have been made to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data, caution should be exercised when interpreting the results as artifacts are possible from nonspecific effects such as assay signal interference. The curve fitting and activity calls presented here are based on the NCATS analysis methods. Alternative analysis methods and interpretations of the data are available at EPA (http://actor.epa.gov) and NTP (http://tools.niehs.nih.gov/cebs3/ui/)._||_Compound Ranking:_||_1. Compounds are first classified as having full titration curves, partial modulation, partial curve (weaker actives), single point activity (at highest concentration only), or inactive. See data field 'Curve Description'. For this assay, apparent inhibitors are ranked higher than compounds that showed apparent activation._||_2. For all inactive compounds, PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE is 0. For all active compounds, a score range was given for each curve class type given above.

489,1346799,Confirmatory,qhts assay to identify small molecule agonists of the progesterone receptor (pr) signaling pathway - cell viability counter screen,"U.S. Tox21 Program_||_National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences [NCATS]_||_NIH Chemical Genomics Center [NCGC]_||_U.S. Environmental Protection Agency [EPA]_||_National Institutes of Environmental Health Sciences [NIEHS]_||_National Toxicology Program [NTP]_||_U.S. Food and Drug Administration [FDA]_||_Tox21 Assay Overview:_||_Progesterone receptor (PR), a nuclear hormone receptor, plays an important role in development, metabolic homeostasis and reproduction. It is activated by the steroid hormone progesterone. Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and their interactions with steroid hormone receptors like PR causes disruption of normal endocrine function. To identify the compounds that stimulate PR signaling, a PR-UAS-bla GripTite cell line i.e. PR-UAS-bla HEK293T (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) containing a beta-lactamase reporter gene under the control of an UAS response element was used to screen Tox21 10K compound library. The cytotoxicity of the Tox21 compound library against the PR-bla cell line was tested in parallel by measuring the cell viability using CellTiter-Glo assay in the same wells.","Disclaimer:_||_Although all reasonable efforts have been made to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data, caution should be exercised when interpreting the results as artifacts are possible from nonspecific effects such as assay signal interference. The curve fitting and activity calls presented here are based on the NCATS analysis methods. Alternative analysis methods and interpretations of the data are available at EPA (http://actor.epa.gov) and NTP (http://tools.niehs.nih.gov/cebs3/ui/)._||_Compound Ranking:_||_1. Compounds are first classified as having full titration curves, partial modulation, partial curve (weaker actives), single point activity (at highest concentration only), or inactive. See data field 'Curve Description'. For this assay, apparent inhibitors are ranked higher than compounds that showed apparent activation._||_2. For all inactive compounds, PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE is 0. For all active compounds, a score range was given for each curve class type given above.

It is activated by the steroid hormone progesterone. Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and their interactions with steroid hormone receptors like PR causes disruption of normal endocrine function. To identify the compounds that inhibit PR signaling, a PR-UAS-bla GripTite cell line i.e. PR-UAS-bla HEK293T (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) containing a beta-lactamase reporter gene under the control of an Upstream Activator Sequence (UAS) was used to screen Tox21 10K compound library. To differentiate true PR antagonists from cytotoxic substances, the assay is multiplexed with a cell viability assay.","This summary is written for the purposes of summarizing the compound activities from the project combining the results from both the PR antagonist mode assay (AID 1346795) and cell viability counter screen (AID 1346798). For all inactive compounds, PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE is 0. Active compounds have PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE between 40 and 100. Potency and efficacy were used for determining relative score. Inconclusive compounds have PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE between 5 and 30 determined by phenotype._||_Disclaimer:_||_Although all reasonable efforts have been made to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data, caution should be exercised when interpreting the results as artifacts are possible from nonspecific effects such as assay signal interference.

It is activated by the steroid hormone progesterone. Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and their interactions with steroid hormone receptors like PR causes disruption of normal endocrine function. To identify the compounds that stimulate PR signaling, a PR-UAS-bla GripTite cell line i.e. PR-UAS-bla HEK293T (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) containing a beta-lactamase reporter gene under the control of an UAS response element was used to screen Tox21 10K compound library. The cytotoxicity of the Tox21 compound library against the PR-bla cell line was tested in parallel by measuring the cell viability using CellTiter-Glo assay in the same wells. To differentiate true PR agonists from cytotoxic substances, the assay is multiplexed with a cell viability assay. The compounds were also tested for auto fluorescence that may interfere with the biological target readout resulting in potential false positives and/or negatives.","This summary is written for the purposes of summarizing the compound activities from the project combining the results from both the PR agonist mode assay (AID 1346784), cell viability counter screen (AID 1346799), and auto fluorescence counter screens (AIDs 720687, 720685, 720678 and 720681). For all inactive compounds, PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE is 0. Active compounds have PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE between 40 and 100. Potency and efficacy were used for determining relative score. Inconclusive compounds have PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE between 5 and 30 determined by phenotype._||_Disclaimer:_||_Although all reasonable efforts have been made to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data, caution should be exercised when interpreting the results as artifacts are possible from nonspecific effects such as assay signal interference.

Starting from an orally available compound with demonstrated anti-inflammatory activity in rat, a soft-drug strategy was implemented to ensure rapid elimination of drug candidates to minimize systemic GR activation. The first clinical candidate 1b (AZD5423) displayed a potent inhibition of lung edema in a rat model of allergic airway inflammation following dry powder inhalation combined with a moderate systemic GR-effect, assessed as thymic involution. Further optimization of inhaled drug properties provided a second, equally potent, candidate, 15m (AZD7594), that demonstrated an improved therapeutic ratio over the benchmark inhaled corticosteroid 3 (fluticasone propionate) and prolonged the inhibition of lung edema, indicating potential for once-daily treatment.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: J Med Chem_||_Year: 2017_||_Volume: 60_||_Issue: 20_||_First Page: 8591_||_Last Page: 8605_||_DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01215_||_Target ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL208_||_ChEMBL Target Name: Progesterone receptor_||_ChEMBL Target Type: SINGLE PROTEIN - Target is a single protein chain_||_Relationship Type: D - Direct protein target assigned_||_Confidence: Direct single protein target assigned,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4031199,20200622,20220830,,,5241,,P06401,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,28937774,0,,P06401,9606.0,,,8.0,5.0,,,,unknown,progesterone receptor,True,True,False,True

Herein is reported a series of potent and selective ERβ agonists (SERBAs) with in vivo efficacy that are A-C estrogens, lacking the B and D estrogen rings. The most potent and selective A-C estrogen is selective for activating ER relative to seven other nuclear hormone receptors, with a surprising 750-fold selectivity for the β over α isoform and with EC<sub>50</sub>s of 20-30 nM in cell-based and direct binding assays. Comparison of potency in different assays suggests that the ER isoform selectivity is related to the compound's ability to drive the productive conformational change needed to activate transcription. The compound also shows in vivo efficacy after microinfusion into the dorsal hippocampus and after intraperitoneal injection (0.5 mg/kg) or oral gavage (0.5 mg/kg). This simple yet novel A-C estrogen is selective, brain penetrant, and facilitates memory consolidation.",Journal: J Med Chem_||_Year: 2018_||_Volume: 61_||_Issue: 11_||_First Page: 4720_||_Last Page: 4738_||_DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01601_||_Target ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL208_||_ChEMBL Target Name: Progesterone receptor_||_ChEMBL Target Type: SINGLE PROTEIN - Target is a single protein chain_||_Relationship Type: D - Direct protein target assigned_||_Confidence: Direct single protein target assigned,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4371252,20210302,20210302,122700657,440165497,5241,,P06401,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,29741891,0,,P06401,9606.0,,,1.0,,,,,agonist,progesterone receptor,True,False,False,False

Here, we describe the structure and property-driven lead generation and optimization, which resulted in identification of MR modulators ( S)-1 and ( S)-33. Both compounds were partial MRAs but still demonstrated equally efficacious organ protection as eplerenone after 4 weeks of treatment in uni-nephrectomized rats on high-salt diet and aldosterone infusion. Importantly, and in sharp contrast to eplerenone, this was achieved without substantial changes to the urine Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ratio after acute treatment in rat, which predicts a reduced risk for hyperkalemia. This work led to selection of ( S)-1 (AZD9977) as the clinical candidate for treating MR-mediated cardio-renal diseases, including chronic kidney disease and heart failure. On the basis of our findings, we propose an empirical model for prediction of compounds with low risk of affecting the urinary Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ratio in vivo.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: J Med Chem_||_Year: 2019_||_Volume: 62_||_Issue: 3_||_First Page: 1385_||_Last Page: 1406_||_DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b01523_||_Target ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL208_||_ChEMBL Target Name: Progesterone receptor_||_ChEMBL Target Type: SINGLE PROTEIN - Target is a single protein chain_||_Relationship Type: D - Direct protein target assigned_||_Confidence: Direct single protein target assigned,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4423292,20210302,20220830,443872|84429708|110763791|118599756|135567449|155514304|155517819|155518137|155518139|155527406|155528935|155529625|155537601|155550102|155557239|155561077|155567245,103752013|440115466|440120754|440121233|440121235|440135602|440137943|440139016|440144718|440149019|440151139|440160324|440180858|440198762|440208563|440209191|440224161,5241,,P06401,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,30596500,0,,P06401,9606.0,,,17.0,1.0,,,,unknown,progesterone receptor,True,True,False,True

In order to solve the problem of drug resistance in the treatment of prostate cancer, proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTAC) was introduced into the design of anti-prostate cancer derivatives. In this work, we synthesized two series of selective androgen receptor degraders (SARDs) containing the hydrophobic degrons with different linker, and then investigated the structure-activity relationships of these hybrid compounds. Most of the synthesized compounds exhibited moderate to good activity against all the cancer cell lines selected. Among them, compound A9 displayed potent inhibitory activity against LNCaP prostate cancer cell line with IC values of 1.75 μM, as well as excellent AR degradation activity. Primary mechanism studies elucidated compound A9 arrested cell cycle at G0/G1 phase and induced a mild apoptotic response in LNCaP cells. Further study indicated that the degradation of AR was mediated through proteasome-mediated process.

The marine sesterterpene compound MHO7 had been reported to be a potential ERα degradation agent. In order to further improve its biological activity, two series of novel MHO7 derivatives with long side chains were designed and identified as novel selective estrogen receptor down-regulators (SERDs). The growth inhibition activity of the novel SERD compounds were significantly affected by the type and length of the side chain. Most of the derivatives were significantly more potent than MHO7 against both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant breast cancer cells. Among them, compound 16a, with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 0.41 μM against MCF-7 cell lines and 9.6-fold stronger than MHO7, was the most potential molecule. A whole-genome transcriptomic analysis of MCF-7 cells revealed that the mechanism of 16a against MCF-7 cell was similar with that of MHO7. The estrogen signaling pathway was the most affected among the disturbed genes, but the ERα degradation activity of 16a was observed higher than that of MHO7. Other effects of 16a were confirmed similar with MHO7, which means that the basic mechanisms of the derivatives are the same with the ophiobolin backbone, i.e. the degradation of ERα is mediated via proteasome-mediated process, the induction of apoptosis and the cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase. Meanwhile, a decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential and an increase of cellular ROS were also detected. Based on these results, as a novel modified ophiobolin derived compound, 16a may warrant further exploitation as a promising SERD candidate agent for the treatment of breast cancer.",Journal: Eur J Med Chem_||_Year: 2022_||_Volume: 229_||_First Page: 114081_||_Last Page: 114081_||_DOI: 10.1016/j.ejmech.2021.114081_||_Target ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL208_||_ChEMBL Target Name: Progesterone receptor_||_ChEMBL Target Type: SINGLE PROTEIN - Target is a single protein chain_||_Relationship Type: D - Direct protein target assigned_||_Confidence: Direct single protein target assigned,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL5044540,20230314,20230314,166625888,475979211,5241,,P06401,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,34992039,0,,P06401,9606.0,,,1.0,,,,,unknown,progesterone receptor,True,False,False,False

Although the very slow CNS clearance and strong binding to adrenergic receptors discouraged focus on conessine itself for further development, its potency and novel steroid-based skeleton motivated further chemical investigation.

In this instance, the target is a pharmacophore derived from a series of active structures either by a novel interpretation of molecular field analysis data or by a pharmacophore-mapping procedure based on clique detection. After a brief introduction to PRO_LIGAND, a detailed description is given of the two pharmacophore generation procedures and their abilities are demonstrated by the elucidation of pharmacophores for steroid binding and ACE inhibition, respectively.

These hepatic and systemic responses might be dissected, leading to liver-selective pharmacology, when a GR antagonist is linked to a bile acid in an appropriate manner. Bile acid conjugation can be accomplished with a minimal loss of binding affinity for GR. The resultant conjugates remain potent in cell-based functional assays. A novel in vivo assay has been developed to simultaneously evaluate both hepatic and systemic GR blockade; this assay has been used to optimize the nature and site of the linker functionality, as well as the choice of the GR antagonist and the bile acid. This optimization led to the identification of A-348441, which reduces glucose levels and improves lipid profiles in an animal model of diabetes.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: J.

Though widely prescribed for pain and inflammation, these agents have limited utility in chronic diseases due to serious mechanism-based adverse events such as gastrointestinal damage. Concomitant blockade of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) enhances the therapeutic effects of the NSAIDs while attenuating their propensity to cause gastrointestinal injury. This favorable interaction is attributed to the accumulation of protective FAAH substrates, such as the endocannabinoid anandamide, and suggests that agents simultaneously targeting COX and FAAH might provide an innovative strategy to combat pain and inflammation with reduced side effects. Here, we describe the rational design and structure-active relationship (SAR) properties of the first class of potent multitarget FAAH-COX inhibitors. A focused SAR exploration around the prototype 10r (ARN2508) led to the identification of achiral (18b) as well as racemic (29a-c and 29e) analogs. Absolute configurational assignment and pharmacological evaluation of single enantiomers of 10r are also presented.

Isosteric replacement of the cis-amide with five-membered heterocycles led to the identification of imidazole 17 (MA-0204), a potent, selective PPARδ modulator with good pharmacokinetic properties. MA-0204 was tested in vivo in mice and in vitro in patient-derived muscle myoblasts (from Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) patients); 17 altered the expression of PPARδ target genes and improved fatty acid oxidation, which supports the therapeutic hypothesis for the study of MA-0204 in DMD patients.",Journal: ACS Med Chem Lett_||_Year: 2018_||_Volume: 9_||_Issue: 9.0_||_First Page: 935_||_Last Page: 940_||_DOI: 10.1021/acsmedchemlett.8b00287_||_Target ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL208_||_ChEMBL Target Name: Progesterone receptor_||_ChEMBL Target Type: SINGLE PROTEIN - Target is a single protein chain_||_Relationship Type: D - Direct protein target assigned_||_Confidence: Direct single protein target assigned,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4721938,20220318,20220318,126752361,442064544,5241,,P06401,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,30258544,0,,P06401,9606.0,,,1.0,,,,,unknown,progesterone receptor,True,True,True,False

In vitro binding studies show that 7 alpha-IDHT binds with high affinity to the rat and human androgen receptor (RBA = 74) compared to R1881 (RBA = 100). Further, this compound showed high specificity for the androgen receptor. 7 alpha-IDHT showed only a marginal affinity for the progestin receptor and even less affinity for the estrogen receptor. No binding was detected to the glucocorticoid receptor. These characteristics make 7 alpha-IDHT a potentially ideal agent for imaging and evaluation of androgen-receptor-containing tissues.",Journal: J. Med.

Compounds with both aromatase inhibitory and estrogen receptor modulatory activities could have special advantages for treatment of breast cancer. Our previous efforts led to the discovery of norendoxifen as the first compound with dual aromatase inhibitory and estrogen receptor binding activities. To optimize its efficacy and aromatase selectivity versus other cytochrome P450 enzymes, a series of structurally related norendoxifen analogues were designed and synthesized. The most potent compound, 4'-hydroxynorendoxifen (10), displayed elevated inhibitory potency against aromatase and enhanced affinity for estrogen receptors when compared to norendoxifen. The selectivity of 10 for aromatase versus other cytochrome P450 enzymes was also superior to norendoxifen. 4'-Hydroxynorendoxifen is therefore an interesting lead for further development to obtain new anticancer agents of potential value for the treatment of breast cancer.",Journal: J.

Starting with the triarylethylene acrylic acid SERD 4, we have investigated how alterations in both the ligand core structure and the appended acrylic acid substituent affect SERD activity. The new ligands were based on high affinity, symmetrical cyclofenil or bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane core systems, and in these, the position of the carboxyl group was extended from the ligand core, either retaining the vinylic linkage of the substituent or replacing it with an ether linkage. Although most structural variants showed binding affinities for ERalpha and ERbeta higher than that of 4, only the compounds preserving the acrylic acid side chain retained SERD activity, although they could possess varying core structures. Hence, the acrylic acid moiety of the ligand is crucial for SERD-like blockade of ER activities.",Journal: J. Med.

Structure based design together with systematic investigation of each region of the molecular architecture led to the identification of N-[1-(3-fluoropropyl)azetidin-3-yl]-6-[(6S,8R)-8-methyl-7-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinolin-6-yl]pyridin-3-amine (28). This compound was demonstrated to be a highly potent SERD that showed a pharmacological profile comparable to fulvestrant in its ability to degrade ERα in both MCF-7 and CAMA-1 cell lines. A stringent control of lipophilicity ensured that 28 had favorable physicochemical and preclinical pharmacokinetic properties for oral administration.

Once daily oral treatment with the lead compound 11a (AR Ki = 0.9 nM, EC50 = 1.8 nM) for 14 days induced muscle growth with an ED50 of 0.09 mg/kg, providing approximately 50-fold selectivity over prostate growth in an orchidectomized rat model. Pharmacokinetic studies in rats demonstrated that the lead compound 11a had oral bioavailability of 65% and a plasma half-life of 5.5 h.

Profiling in binding and functional assays led to the identification of LXR modulator GSK9772 ( 20) as a high-affinity LXRbeta ligand (IC 50 = 30 nM) that shows separation of anti-inflammatory and lipogenic activities in human macrophage and liver cell lines, respectively. A cocrystal structure of the structurally related analog 19 bound to LXRbeta reveals regions within the receptor that can affect receptor modulation through ligand modification. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that 20 is greater than 10-fold selective for LXR-mediated transrepression of proinflammatory gene expression versus transactivation of lipogenic signaling pathways, thus providing an opportunity for the identification of LXR modulators with improved therapeutic indexes.",Journal: J.

Their development is particularly challenging, since differences in the ligand binding cavities of the two ER subtypes α and β are minimal. We have carried out a rational design of new salicylketoxime derivatives which display unprecedentedly high levels of ERβ selectivity for this class of compounds, both in binding affinity and in cell-based functional assays. An endogenous gene expression assay was used to further characterize the pharmacological action of these compounds. Finally, these ERβ-selective agonists were found to inhibit proliferation of a glioma cell line in vitro. Most importantly, one of these compounds also proved to be active in an in vivo xenograft model of human glioma, thus demonstrating the high potential of this type of compounds against this devastating disease.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: J.

These compounds were synthesized in 6 steps from hydrocortisone and in 13 steps from 1,4-androstadiene-3,11,17-trione, respectively. Relative binding affinities (RBA) of 11 beta-F-DHT and 11 beta-F-19-nor-DHT to AR are 53.1 and 75.3 (R1881 = 100), respectively, the latter being the highest reported among fluorine-substituted androgens. The fluorination step, which involves addition of halogen fluoride across the 9(11)-double bond, followed by reductive dehalogenation at the 9 alpha-position has been adapted to introduce a fluorine-18-label at the 11 beta-position of DHT and 19-nor-DHT. The two high-affinity F-18-labeled ligands [18F]-1 and [18F]-2 were evaluated in vivo, in tissue distribution studies using diethylstilbestrol-pretreated mature male rats. 11 beta-F-DHT shows high prostate uptake and selective prostate to blood and prostate to muscle uptake ratios, the latter two ratios increasing from 5 and 8 at 1 h to 12 and 19 at 4 h postinjection. Moreover, this compound has low uptake in bone, displaying the lowest in vivo defluorination among all androgens labeled with fluorine-18 tested so far. The in vivo properties of 11 beta-F-DHT in rats are thus favorable for imaging of prostate cancer. On the other hand, 11 beta-F-19-nor-DHT shows low prostate uptake with low selectivity and high uptake in liver, kidney, and bladder. Even though this ligand has the highest RBA and undergoes little metabolic defluorination, it appears to suffer from rapid metabolism in vivo. Therefore, it is apparent that the biodistribution properties of androgens are affected by their structure and metabolism as well as by their RBA.",Journal: J. Med.

Herein we report the discovery of various spirooxindole and dibenzoxazepine constructs as potent MR antagonists. SAR analysis of our spirooxindole hit led to highly potent compounds containing polar solubilizing groups, which interact with the helix-11 region of the MR ligand binding domain (LBD). Various dibenzoxazepine moieties were also prepared in an effort to replace a known dibenzoxepane system which interacts with the hydrophobic region of the MR LBD.

Selective estrogen receptor modulators, such as Tamoxifen, have showed great benefits in the treatment and prevention of breast cancer. But the disadvantages of induction of endometrial cancer and drug resistance have limited their use. Multiple ligand which act at multiple biomolecular targets may exert favorable advantages of improved efficacy with lower incidence of side effects. In this work, we described the synthesis and evaluation of a series of 6-aryl-indenoisoquinolone derivatives as dual ERα and VEGFR-2 inhibitors. These compounds presented good ERα binding affinity and ERα antagonistic activity, as well as potent VEGFR-2 inhibitory potency. They also possessed excellent anti-proliferative activities against MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, Ishikawa and HUVEC cell lines. Further investigation of selective compound 21c showed that it was able to inhibit the activation of VEGFR-2 and the signaling transduction of Raf-1/MAPK/ERK pathway in MCF-7 cells.",Journal: Eur. J.

Previous efforts led to the preparation of norendoxifen (4) derivatives with dual aromatase inhibitory activity and estrogen receptor binding activity. In the present study, some of the structural features of the potent AI letrozole were incorporated into the lead compound (norendoxifen) to afford a series of new dual AI/SERM agents based on a symmetrical diphenylmethylene substructure that eliminates the problem of E,Z isomerization encountered with norendoxifen-based AI/SERMs. Compound 12d had good aromatase inhibitory activity (IC50=62.2nM) while also exhibiting good binding activity to both ER-α (EC50=72.1nM) and ER-β (EC50=70.8nM).

Although these drugs have showed great benefits in the treatment of breast cancer, the risk of endometrial cancer and endocrine resistance restrict their use. The reasonable designing of multi-target drugs can decrease the side effects and improve the tolerance of antineoplastic agents Studies have identified that VEGFR-2 plays a pivotal role in tumor angiogenesis and drug resistance. Besides, a combination of Tamoxifen and low dose of a VEGFR-2 inhibitor was reported to maximize therapeutic efficacy as well as to retard SERM resistant tumor growth. In this work, a series of 3-aryl-quinolin derivatives were designed to target to ERα and VEGFR-2 to eliminate the disadvantages of SERMs. We identified that compounds 12f and 13f displayed highly ERα binding affinities as well as relative intensity VEGFR-2 inhibitory activities. Moreover, this two compounds exhibited excellent anti-proliferative activities against MCF-7 and HUVEC cell lines with low micromolar IC<sub>50</sub> (1-8 μM). A further study confirmed that compound 13f can reduce the expression of PgR mRNA, arrest cell cycle in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, and restrain the cell migration.

They are a very effective therapy, but they are associated with both unwanted local effects in the skin (skin thinning/atrophy) and systemic side effects. These effects can limit the long-term utility of potent steroids. Here we report on a topically delivered non-steroidal GR agonist, that has the potential to deliver high efficacy in the skin, but due to rapid metabolism in the blood & liver ('dual-soft') it should have greater systemic safety than existing treatments. In addition, compared to less selective steroidal GR agonists, the new non-steroidal Selective Glucocorticoid Agonists (SEGRAs) have the potential to avoid the skin atrophy observed with existing topical steroids. Due to its potential for reduced skin atrophy and low systemic exposure, LEO 134310 (17) may be suitable for long term topical treatment of skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis.",Journal: Bioorg Med Chem Lett_||_Year: 2020_||_Volume: 30_||_Issue: 17_||_First Page: 127402_||_Last Page: 127402_||_DOI: 10.1016/j.bmcl.2020.127402,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4727370,20220318,20220318,126714060,461538306,,,,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,32738970,0,,,9606.0,,,1.0,,,,,agonist,unknown,False,False,False,False

Thus, MR antagonists (MRAs) are expected to be beneficial to patients with these diseases. In order to identify novel nonsteroidal MRAs that overcome the issues of already marketed steroidal MRAs, we searched for new compounds guided by our hypothesis that T-shaped compounds with a hydrophobic core structure, two polar functional groups at both extremities able to interact with MR, and a bulky substituent that can interfere with the folding of the C-terminal helix 12 may exhibit antagonist activity toward MR. We discovered that the novel 1,4-benzoxazin-3-one derivative <b>19</b> (apararenone: MT-3995) acted as a highly selective and potent nonsteroidal MRA. Apararenone exhibited a more potent antihypertensive and organ-protective activity than steroidal MRA eplerenone in a primary aldosteronism rat model obtained by infusing aldosterone in uninephrectomized rats.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: J Med Chem_||_Year: 2022_||_Volume: 65_||_Issue: 12.0_||_First Page: 8127_||_Last Page: 8143_||_DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.2c00402,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL5136120,20230629,20230629,5833|443872|24744336,103469419|103752013|163339107,,,,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,35652647,0,,,9606.0,,,3.0,1.0,,,,unknown,unknown,False,True,False,False

Detailed SAR is discussed with a focus on improving PR and MR selectivity, GR agonism, and in vitro dissociation profile. SAR analysis led to compound (R)-33 which showed high PR and MR selectivity, potent agonist activity, and reduced transactivation activity in the MMTV and aromatase assays. The compound is equipotent to prednisolone in the LPS-TNF model of inflammation. In mouse CIA, at 30 mg/kg compound (R)-33 inhibited disease progression with an efficacy similar to the 3 mg/kg dose of prednisolone.",Journal: Bioorg. Med. Chem.

Although these drugs have showed great benefits in the treatment of breast cancer, the risk of endometrial cancer and endocrine resistance restrict their use. The reasonable designing of multi-target drugs can decrease the side effects and improve the tolerance of antineoplastic agents Studies have identified that VEGFR-2 plays a pivotal role in tumor angiogenesis and drug resistance. Besides, a combination of Tamoxifen and low dose of a VEGFR-2 inhibitor was reported to maximize therapeutic efficacy as well as to retard SERM resistant tumor growth. In this work, a series of 3-aryl-quinolin derivatives were designed to target to ERα and VEGFR-2 to eliminate the disadvantages of SERMs. We identified that compounds 12f and 13f displayed highly ERα binding affinities as well as relative intensity VEGFR-2 inhibitory activities. Moreover, this two compounds exhibited excellent anti-proliferative activities against MCF-7 and HUVEC cell lines with low micromolar IC<sub>50</sub> (1-8 μM). A further study confirmed that compound 13f can reduce the expression of PgR mRNA, arrest cell cycle in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, and restrain the cell migration. Overall, based on the biological activities data, 13f can be chosen as a potential anti-cancer lead compound for further studying.",Journal: Eur J Med Chem_||_Year: 2019_||_Volume: 161_||_First Page: 445_||_Last Page: 455_||_DOI: 10.1016/j.ejmech.2018.10.045_||_Target ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL387_||_ChEMBL Target Name: MCF7_||_ChEMBL Target Type: CELL-LINE - Target is a specific cell-line_||_Relationship Type: N - Non-molecular target assigned_||_Confidence: Target assigned is non-molecular,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4327498,20210302,20210302,2733526|155521404,103170100|440126422,,,,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,30384047,0,,,,31.0,,2.0,,,,,unknown,MCF7,False,False,True,False

(red clover) is a popular botanical supplement used for women's health. Irilone isolated from red clover previously demonstrated progestogenic potentiation activity. In this study, irilone enhanced progesterone signaling was determined to not occur due to post-translational phosphorylation or by reducing progesterone receptor (PR) protein levels but instead increased PR protein levels in T47D breast cancer cells, which could be blocked by estrogen receptor (ER) antagonists, suggesting an ER dependent effect. Further, irilone increased luciferase activity from a hormone responsive element in a cell line that lacked ER and PR but expressed the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). A siRNA knockdown of GR in Ishikawa PR-B endometrial cancer cells reduced irilone's ability to enhance progesterone signaling. In an ovariectomized CD-1 mouse model, irilone did not induce uterine epithelial cell proliferation.

The introduction of a 5-aryl group into the 1,2-dihydrocoumarino[3,4-f]quinoline core 1 is the key for progestational activities. The structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies of the 5-aryl substituents generated a series of potent hPR agonists, which exhibited similar biological activity (EC50 = 8-30 nM) to the natural hormone progesterone (EC50 = 2.9 nM) in cell-based assays with efficacies ranging from 28% to 96%. Most of the analogues displayed similar or greater binding affinity (Ki = 0.41-3.6 nM) than progesterone (Ki = 3.5 nM). Three representative analogues (13, 15, and 24) demonstrated in vivo activities in mammary gland morphology/uterine wet weight assay in ovariectomized rats.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: J.

The introduction of a 5-aryl group into the 1,2-dihydrocoumarino[3,4-f]quinoline core 1 is the key for progestational activities. The structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies of the 5-aryl substituents generated a series of potent hPR agonists, which exhibited similar biological activity (EC50 = 8-30 nM) to the natural hormone progesterone (EC50 = 2.9 nM) in cell-based assays with efficacies ranging from 28% to 96%. Most of the analogues displayed similar or greater binding affinity (Ki = 0.41-3.6 nM) than progesterone (Ki = 3.5 nM). Three representative analogues (13, 15, and 24) demonstrated in vivo activities in mammary gland morphology/uterine wet weight assay in ovariectomized rats.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: J.

A siRNA knockdown of GR in Ishikawa PR-B endometrial cancer cells reduced irilone's ability to enhance progesterone signaling. In an ovariectomized CD-1 mouse model, irilone did not induce uterine epithelial cell proliferation.

For each quinoline, the levorotatory enantiomer was determined to be the more potent agonist of the human progesterone receptor isoform B (hPR-B) (EC50 < 3 nM), but the dextrorotatory enantiomers retained significant PR modulatory activity (EC50 < 200 nM). In two in vivo rodent models of progestational activity, a pregnancy maintenance assay and a uterine wet weight assay, the two eutomers displayed potent progesterone-like effects. In a third model for progestational activity, the mammary end bud assay, these compounds were significantly less active. These studies demonstrate that certain members of this class of selective progesterone receptor modulators display encouraging and potentially useful tissue-selective progestational effects.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: J.

The introduction of a 17alpha-pentafluorethyl side chain in the D-ring of the steroid skeleton allowed the combination of high antiprogestagenic activity with little or no other endocrinological effects. In contrast to many other antiprogestins, ZK 230211 did not convert to an agonist in the presence of protein kinase A (PKA) activators and showed high antiprogestagenic activity on both PR isoforms PR-A and PR-B. This high antiprogestagenic activity could also be demonstrated in several in vivo models. Furthermore, this compound displayed only marginal antiglucocorticoid effects. In tumor models ZK 230211 exhibited strong antiproliferative action. The pharmacological properties of ZK 230211 may prove useful in the treatment of endometriosis, leiomyomas, breast cancer, and in hormone replacement therapy.",Journal: J. Med.

A siRNA knockdown of GR in Ishikawa PR-B endometrial cancer cells reduced irilone's ability to enhance progesterone signaling. In an ovariectomized CD-1 mouse model, irilone did not induce uterine epithelial cell proliferation. The mechanism of action of irilone gives insight into PR crosstalk with other steroid hormone receptors, which can be important for understanding botanicals that are used for women's health.",Journal: J Nat Prod_||_Year: 2021_||_Volume: 84_||_Issue: 12.0_||_First Page: 3090_||_Last Page: 3099_||_DOI: 10.1021/acs.jnatprod.1c00835,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4842183,20220830,20220830,5281779,312466910,,,,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,34813298,0,,,9606.0,7476.0,,1.0,,,Uterus,,unknown,unknown,False,False,True,False

The lead compound LG001447 (1,2-dihydro-2,2, 4-trimethyl-6-phenylquinoline) was discovered via directed high throughput screening of a defined chemical library utilizing an hPR-B cotransfection assay. Electron-withdrawing substituents at the meta position of the C(6) aryl group afforded substantial improvements in hPR modulatory activity. Several analogues were able to potently block the effects of progesterone in vitro. Two compounds, 10 (LG120753) and 11 (LG120830) with potencies comparable or equal to the steroidal hPR antagonist onapristone (ZK98,299), were demonstrated to act as antiprogestins in vivo after oral administration to rodents.

In combination with a halogen (F or Cl) at C(9), replacement of the C(5) aryl group with variously substituted aryl groups resulted in optimization of the progestational activity, affording compounds with in vitro activity greater than that of progesterone as measured by a cotransfection assay using human progesterone receptor subtype-B (hPR-B). Binding affinities (Ki) to hPR-A were subnanomolar in many cases. These in vitro effects were verified in vivo using a rodent model. Compound 10 (LG120794, 9-chloro-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1,2-dihydro-2,2,4-trimethyl-5H-chromeno++ +[3,4-f] quinoline) was more potent than medroxyprogesterone acetate at counterpoising the effects of estradiol benzoate in the uterine wet weight assay using immature rats.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: J.

Structure-activity relationships and fluorescence properties._||_Abstract: Progesterone is involved in multiple physiological processes, including female reproduction, via binding to the progesterone receptor (PR). We have developed 6-arylcoumarins such as 5 and 6 as non-steroidal PR antagonists with receptor-binding-dependent fluorescence. In this study, we investigated the structure-activity relationships and fluorescence properties of coumarin derivatives bearing a heterocyclic aromatic moiety. Among these derivatives, 7c (IC50: 34nM) and 10b (IC50: 24nM) showed more potent PR-antagonistic activity than lead compounds 5 (IC50: 500nM) and 6 (IC50: 65nM) in alkaline phosphatase (AP) assay.

However, the steroidal structure of PR antagonists could bind to other hormone receptors, thus leading to serious side effects. On the other hand, non-steroidal PR antagonists have rarely been evaluated for their anti-cancer efficacy. Therefore, identifying novel non-steroidal PR antagonists possessing potent anti-cancer efficacy would be an attractive project to pursue. In this study, we presented a new metal-free oxidative CH arylation method to rapidly synthesize a series of 6-aryl-6H-benzo[c]chromene derivatives. Multiple cancer cell lines were used for their anti-cancer activity screening. An extensive analysis of structure-activity relationships (SAR) of the derivatives revealed that compounds 32 and 34 markedly inhibited the proliferation of MCF-7 cells with IC values of 6.32 ± 0.52 μM and 5.71 ± 0.49 μM, respectively. Further investigation indicated that derivatives 32 and 34 could elevate the expression of p21 and decrease the expressions of CDK4 and cyclin D1, leading to cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase. In addition, derivatives 32 and 34 could induce apoptosis of MCF-7 cells in both dose- and time-dependent manners by activation of p53 pathway, i.e., activation of Cleaved Caspase-3, p53 and P-p53 as well as elevation of the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. Docking of derivatives 32 and 34 into a PR homology model exhibited potent PR antagonistic activity indicating the 6-aryl-6H-benzo[c]chromene derivatives are promising PR antagonists. We envisioned that derivatives 32 and 34 might be potential anti-cancer drug candidates as novel therapeutic treatment for breast cancer.",Journal: Bioorg Med Chem_||_Year: 2021_||_Volume: 32_||_First Page: 116003_||_Last Page: 116003_||_DOI: 10.1016/j.bmc.2021.116003_||_Target ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL208_||_ChEMBL Target Name: Progesterone receptor_||_ChEMBL Target Type: SINGLE PROTEIN - Target is a single protein chain_||_Relationship Type: D - Direct protein target assigned_||_Confidence: Direct single protein target assigned,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4689412,20220318,20220318,162647017|162668588,461520158|461550988,5241,,P06401,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,33461148,0,,P06401,9606.0,,,2.0,2.0,,Breast,,antagonist,progesterone receptor,True,False,True,False

The 5-alkyl substitution was shown to be responsible for the agonist activity and substitution at C9 dramatically enhanced the potency.

The 3-keto group was discovered to regain the potent agonist activity which was lost upon removal of the 3,4-olefin, and it led to a novel hPR agonist series, 5-aryl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrochromeno[3, 4-f]quinolin-3-ones. The new progestins demonstrated potent hPR agonist activity in the cotransfection assay and high binding affinity similar to progesterone. T47D human breast cancer cell line was employed for further characterization of the new progestins and a number of reference analogues. It was found that the new 3-keto analogues showed full agonist activity in the T47D assay, while the reference compounds from other related nonsteroidal hPR agonist series exhibited only partial agonist activity.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: J.

The steroids are 16 alpha, 17 alpha-fluoroacetophenone ketals of 16 alpha, 17 alpha-dihydroxyprogesterone and 16 alpha, 17 alpha, 21-trihydroxy-19-norprogesterone. Synthesis of the latter compound in seven steps from 19-norandrost-4-ene-3,17-dione is reported. Both compounds demonstrate high affinity for the progesterone receptor (PgR) (52.5 and 240%, respectively, relative to R5020 = 100). The syntheses were adapted to 18F-labeling with 4'-[18F]-fluoroacetophenone, prepared from 4'-nitroacetophenone by nucleophilic substitution with K18F/Kryptofix. Considerable adjustment of reaction conditions was required to effect ketalization using tracer quantities of the ketone. In tissue distribution studies in estrogen-primed immature female rats, both ketals showed selective uterine uptake, which was blocked by coinjection of a saturating dose of the unlabeled progestin ORG 2058. Additionally, metabolic stability of the radiolabel was indicated by the low radioactivity levels seen in bone.

The syntheses were adapted to 18F-labeling with 4'-[18F]-fluoroacetophenone, prepared from 4'-nitroacetophenone by nucleophilic substitution with K18F/Kryptofix. Considerable adjustment of reaction conditions was required to effect ketalization using tracer quantities of the ketone. In tissue distribution studies in estrogen-primed immature female rats, both ketals showed selective uterine uptake, which was blocked by coinjection of a saturating dose of the unlabeled progestin ORG 2058. Additionally, metabolic stability of the radiolabel was indicated by the low radioactivity levels seen in bone. Both compounds showed relatively high uptake in fat, in accord with their relative lipophilicities demonstrated by HPLC-derived octanol-water partition coefficients.

The steroids are 16 alpha, 17 alpha-fluoroacetophenone ketals of 16 alpha, 17 alpha-dihydroxyprogesterone and 16 alpha, 17 alpha, 21-trihydroxy-19-norprogesterone. Synthesis of the latter compound in seven steps from 19-norandrost-4-ene-3,17-dione is reported. Both compounds demonstrate high affinity for the progesterone receptor (PgR) (52.5 and 240%, respectively, relative to R5020 = 100). The syntheses were adapted to 18F-labeling with 4'-[18F]-fluoroacetophenone, prepared from 4'-nitroacetophenone by nucleophilic substitution with K18F/Kryptofix. Considerable adjustment of reaction conditions was required to effect ketalization using tracer quantities of the ketone. In tissue distribution studies in estrogen-primed immature female rats, both ketals showed selective uterine uptake, which was blocked by coinjection of a saturating dose of the unlabeled progestin ORG 2058. Additionally, metabolic stability of the radiolabel was indicated by the low radioactivity levels seen in bone. Both compounds showed relatively high uptake in fat, in accord with their relative lipophilicities demonstrated by HPLC-derived octanol-water partition coefficients. The selective uterine uptake and metabolic stability of these compounds suggests that this class of PgR ligands might be promising for the selective imaging of receptor-positive tumors if derivatives of reduced lipophilicity can be prepared.",Journal: J.

901,1815661,Confirmatory,competitive inhibition of glucocorticoid receptor (unknown origin) by fluorescence polarization based competition assay,"Title: The Flavonoid Baicalein Negatively Regulates Progesterone Target Genes in the Uterus <i>in Vivo</i>._||_Abstract: Baicalein is a flavonoid extracted from the root of <i>Scutellaria baicalensis</i> (Chinese skullcap) and is consumed as part of this botanical dietary supplement to reduce oxidative stress, pain, and inflammation. We previously reported that baicalein can also modify receptor signaling through the progesterone receptor (PR) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) <i>in vitro</i>, which is interesting due to the well-established roles of both PR and GR in reducing inflammation. To understand the effects of baicalein on PR and GR signaling <i>in vivo</i> in the uterus, ovariectomized CD-1 mice were treated with DMSO, progesterone (P4), baicalein, P4 with baicalein, and P4 with RU486, a PR antagonist, for a week. The uteri were collected for histology and RNA sequencing. Our results showed that baicalein attenuated the antiproliferative effect of P4 on luminal epithelium as well as on the PR target genes HAND2 and ZBTB16. Baicalein did not change levels of PR or GR RNA or protein in the uterus. RNA sequencing data indicated that many transcripts significantly altered by baicalein were regulated in the opposite direction by P4. Similarly, a large portion of GO/KEGG terms and GSEA gene sets were altered in the opposite direction by baicalein as compared to P4 treatment. Treatment of baicalein did not change body weight, organ weight, or blood glucose level. In summary, baicalein functioned as a PR antagonist <i>in vivo</i> and therefore may oppose P4 action under certain conditions such as uterine hyperplasia, fibroids, and uterine cancers.",Journal: J Nat Prod_||_Year: 2022_||_Volume: 85_||_Issue: 1.0_||_First Page: 237_||_Last Page: 247_||_DOI: 10.1021/acs.jnatprod.1c01008_||_Target ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL2034_||_ChEMBL Target Name: Glucocorticoid receptor_||_ChEMBL Target Type: SINGLE PROTEIN - Target is a single protein chain_||_Relationship Type: D - Direct protein target assigned_||_Confidence: Direct single protein target assigned,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL5038161,20230314,20230314,5281605,103167026,2908,,P04150,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,34935393,0,,P04150,9606.0,,,1.0,,,,,antagonist,Glucocorticoid receptor,False,True,False,False

We have developed 6-arylcoumarins such as 5 and 6 as non-steroidal PR antagonists with receptor-binding-dependent fluorescence. In this study, we investigated the structure-activity relationships and fluorescence properties of coumarin derivatives bearing a heterocyclic aromatic moiety. Among these derivatives, 7c (IC50: 34nM) and 10b (IC50: 24nM) showed more potent PR-antagonistic activity than lead compounds 5 (IC50: 500nM) and 6 (IC50: 65nM) in alkaline phosphatase (AP) assay. Compound 9b showed solvent-dependent fluorescence intensity, exhibiting strong fluorescence in the presence of PR LBD only in buffer solution. On the other hand, 10b showed a solvent-dependent shift of the fluorescence maximum wavelength in the presence of PR LBD. These results indicate that 6-arylcoumarin will be a useful scaffold for PR antagonists and fluorescent probes targeting PR.",Journal: Bioorg Med Chem_||_Year: 2016_||_Volume: 24_||_Issue: 21_||_First Page: 5602_||_Last Page: 5610_||_DOI: 10.1016/j.bmc.2016.09.020_||_Target ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL3507_||_ChEMBL Target Name: Mineralocorticoid receptor_||_ChEMBL Target Type: SINGLE PROTEIN - Target is a single protein chain_||_Relationship Type: D - Direct protein target assigned_||_Confidence: Direct single protein target assigned,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3863113,20180907,20230629,56589542|56589543|102313488|132578540,134442760|134458176|374311654|374352882,25672,,P22199,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,27665178,0,,P22199,10116.0,,,4.0,,,,,unknown,Mineralocorticoid receptor,False,False,False,False

PR plays key roles in various physiological systems, including the female reproductive system, and PR antagonists are candidates for clinical treatment of multiple diseases, including uterine leiomyoma, endometriosis, breast cancer, and some psychiatric disorders. We found that the benzenesulfonanilide skeleton functions as a novel scaffold for PR antagonists, and we adopted 3-chlorobenzenesulfonyl derivative 20a as a lead compound for structural development.

Focusing on the similarity of the GR and progesterone receptor (PR) ligand-binding domain (LBD) structures, we adopted our recently developed PR antagonist 10 as a lead compound and synthesized a series of derivatives. We found that the N-(4-phenoxyphenyl)benzenesulfonamide skeleton serves as a versatile scaffold for GR antagonists. Among them, 4-cyano derivative 14m was the most potent, with an IC50 value of 1.43μM for GR. This compound showed good selectivity for GR; it retained relatively weak antagonistic activity toward PR (IC50 for PR: 8.00μM; 250-fold less potent than 10), but showed no activity toward AR, ERα or ERβ. Interestingly, the 4-amino derivative 15a exhibited transrepression activity toward NF-κB in addition to GR-antagonistic activity, whereas 14m did not. The structure-activity relationship for transrepression was different from that for GR-antagonistic activity. Computational docking simulations suggested that 15a might bind to the ligand-binding pocket of GR in a different manner from 14m. These findings open up new possibilities for developing novel nonsteroidal GR modulators with distinctive activity profiles.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: Bioorg Med Chem_||_Year: 2017_||_Volume: 25_||_Issue: 13_||_First Page: 3461_||_Last Page: 3470_||_DOI: 10.1016/j.bmc.2017.04.032_||_Target ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL208_||_ChEMBL Target Name: Progesterone receptor_||_ChEMBL Target Type: SINGLE PROTEIN - Target is a single protein chain_||_Relationship Type: D - Direct protein target assigned_||_Confidence: Direct single protein target assigned,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4035629,20200621,20220830,,,5241,,P06401,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,28506584,0,,P06401,9606.0,,,1.0,1.0,,,,antagonist,progesterone receptor,True,True,False,True

We previously reported that baicalein can also modify receptor signaling through the progesterone receptor (PR) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) <i>in vitro</i>, which is interesting due to the well-established roles of both PR and GR in reducing inflammation. To understand the effects of baicalein on PR and GR signaling <i>in vivo</i> in the uterus, ovariectomized CD-1 mice were treated with DMSO, progesterone (P4), baicalein, P4 with baicalein, and P4 with RU486, a PR antagonist, for a week. The uteri were collected for histology and RNA sequencing. Our results showed that baicalein attenuated the antiproliferative effect of P4 on luminal epithelium as well as on the PR target genes HAND2 and ZBTB16. Baicalein did not change levels of PR or GR RNA or protein in the uterus. RNA sequencing data indicated that many transcripts significantly altered by baicalein were regulated in the opposite direction by P4. Similarly, a large portion of GO/KEGG terms and GSEA gene sets were altered in the opposite direction by baicalein as compared to P4 treatment.

Radiochemical synthesis of these two species in high radiochemical purity and at high effective specific activity was accomplished by treatment of the corresponding diastereomerically pure 21-trifluoromethanesulfonates with fluorine-18 anion. In tissue biodistribution studies in estrogen-primed immature female Sprague-Dawley rats, both [18F]-endo-10a and [18F]endo-10b demonstrated high PR-selective uptake in the principal target tissues, the uterus and the ovaries, and relatively low uptake in fat and bone. The metabolism at the 21-position in these progestins (as monitored by in vivo defluorination) appears to be less than that in other 21-fluoroprogestins; this may reflect steric inhibition of metabolism at this site due to the bulk of the furan-substituted dioxolane ring at the 16 alpha, 17 alpha-position. Comparison with other fluorine-18-labeled progestins shows that the PR-specific uptake in uterine tissue correlates with the BSI of the ligand and that the fat uptake correlates with the NSB of the ligand at high levels of statistical significance. These two dioxolanes may prove to be useful as breast tumor-imaging agents in humans.",Journal: J. Med.

We designed and synthesized 1,3-diphenyladamantane derivatives, and investigated their PR-antagonistic activity in comparison with our recently developed boron cluster-based PR antagonists. Among the synthesized adamantane derivatives, compound 9a exhibited the most potent PR-antagonistic activity (IC50: 25nM) and showed high binding affinity for the PR ligand-binding domain, comparable with that of the boron cluster-based PR antagonists. These results suggest that disubstituted adamantane, like the boron cluster m-carborane, is a promising hydrophobic pharmacophore for further structural development of nonsteroidal PR antagonists.",Journal: Bioorg.

Although recent evidence indicates that the σ2 receptor binding site is localized within the progesterone receptor membrane component 1 (PGRMC1), most information regarding this protein has been obtained using either radiolabeled or fluorescent receptor-based probes and from biochemical analysis of the effect of σ2 selective ligands on cells grown in culture. This article reviews the development of σ2 receptor ligands and presents an overview of how they have been used in vitro and in vivo to increase our understanding of the role of the σ2 receptor in cancer and proliferation.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: J.

The steroids are 16 alpha, 17 alpha-fluoroacetophenone ketals of 16 alpha, 17 alpha-dihydroxyprogesterone and 16 alpha, 17 alpha, 21-trihydroxy-19-norprogesterone. Synthesis of the latter compound in seven steps from 19-norandrost-4-ene-3,17-dione is reported. Both compounds demonstrate high affinity for the progesterone receptor (PgR) (52.5 and 240%, respectively, relative to R5020 = 100). The syntheses were adapted to 18F-labeling with 4'-[18F]-fluoroacetophenone, prepared from 4'-nitroacetophenone by nucleophilic substitution with K18F/Kryptofix. Considerable adjustment of reaction conditions was required to effect ketalization using tracer quantities of the ketone. In tissue distribution studies in estrogen-primed immature female rats, both ketals showed selective uterine uptake, which was blocked by coinjection of a saturating dose of the unlabeled progestin ORG 2058. Additionally, metabolic stability of the radiolabel was indicated by the low radioactivity levels seen in bone. Both compounds showed relatively high uptake in fat, in accord with their relative lipophilicities demonstrated by HPLC-derived octanol-water partition coefficients.

Tanaproget is a nonsteroidal progestin agonist with very high PR binding affinity and excellent in vivo potency. When appropriately radiolabeled, it might be used to image PR-positive breast tumors noninvasively by positron emission tomography (PET). We describe the synthesis and PR binding affinities of a series of fluoroalkyl-substituted 6-aryl-1,4-dihydrobenzo[d][1,3]oxazine-2-thiones, analogues of Tanaproget. Some of these compounds have subnanomolar binding affinities, higher than that of either Tanaproget itself or the high affinity PR ligand R5020. Structure-binding affinity relationships can be rationalized by molecular modeling of ligand complexes with PR, and the enantioselectivity of binding has been predicted. These compounds are being further evaluated as potential diagnostic PET imaging agents for breast cancer, and enantiomerically pure materials of defined stereochemistry are being prepared.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: J.

Addition of a methyl group at the C10 position of the steroid has a significant impact on progesterone receptor (PR) and androgen receptor (AR) activity. Within this series, OP-3633 (15) emerged as a glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist with increased selectivity against PR and AR, improved cytochrome P450 inhibition profile, and significantly improved pharmacokinetic properties compared to 1.

Synthesis of the latter compound in seven steps from 19-norandrost-4-ene-3,17-dione is reported. Both compounds demonstrate high affinity for the progesterone receptor (PgR) (52.5 and 240%, respectively, relative to R5020 = 100). The syntheses were adapted to 18F-labeling with 4'-[18F]-fluoroacetophenone, prepared from 4'-nitroacetophenone by nucleophilic substitution with K18F/Kryptofix. Considerable adjustment of reaction conditions was required to effect ketalization using tracer quantities of the ketone. In tissue distribution studies in estrogen-primed immature female rats, both ketals showed selective uterine uptake, which was blocked by coinjection of a saturating dose of the unlabeled progestin ORG 2058. Additionally, metabolic stability of the radiolabel was indicated by the low radioactivity levels seen in bone. Both compounds showed relatively high uptake in fat, in accord with their relative lipophilicities demonstrated by HPLC-derived octanol-water partition coefficients.

Structure-activity relationship studies indicated that the shape and the structural bulkiness of the substituent at the 5-position of the isoxazole ring affected FXR-antagonistic activity. Compounds 15 g (5-substituent: 2-naphthyl) and 15 h (5-substituent: 4-biphenyl) were identified as potent antagonists with higher selectivity for FXR over progesterone receptor than the naturally occurring FXR antagonist GS. The 5-substituent is also a critical determinant of the characteristic corepressor recruitment profile of this class of FXR antagonists, though distinct mechanisms appear to be involved: 15 h stabilizes the corepressor-nuclear receptor interaction, while 15 g inhibits coactivator recruitment.",Journal: Bioorg.

SAR study demonstrated that the para-fluorinated substituents on the phenyl ring not only increased the potency for PR in a T47D cell functional assay, but also improved the selectivity over GR in an A549 cell functional assay. The para-fluorophenyl oxa-steroid 4l and the para-trifluoromethylphenyl oxa-steroid 4p were found to be remarkably more potent and more selective PR antagonists than mifepristone, with subnanomolar potency and about 140-fold selectivity over GR. Molecular modeling of the oxa-steroid bound to PR provided meaningful insight for the SAR study. oxa-Steroids 4a and 4b were found to be more efficacious than mifepristone in vivo in a rat uterine complement C3 assay via the oral route, although they were less than or equally potent to mifepristone in the T47D assay.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: Bioorg.

PR plays key roles in various physiological systems, including the female reproductive system, and PR antagonists are candidates for clinical treatment of multiple diseases, including uterine leiomyoma, endometriosis, breast cancer, and some psychiatric disorders.

The introduction of a 17alpha-pentafluorethyl side chain in the D-ring of the steroid skeleton allowed the combination of high antiprogestagenic activity with little or no other endocrinological effects. In contrast to many other antiprogestins, ZK 230211 did not convert to an agonist in the presence of protein kinase A (PKA) activators and showed high antiprogestagenic activity on both PR isoforms PR-A and PR-B. This high antiprogestagenic activity could also be demonstrated in several in vivo models. Furthermore, this compound displayed only marginal antiglucocorticoid effects. In tumor models ZK 230211 exhibited strong antiproliferative action. The pharmacological properties of ZK 230211 may prove useful in the treatment of endometriosis, leiomyomas, breast cancer, and in hormone replacement therapy.",Journal: J. Med.

In contrast to many other antiprogestins, ZK 230211 did not convert to an agonist in the presence of protein kinase A (PKA) activators and showed high antiprogestagenic activity on both PR isoforms PR-A and PR-B. This high antiprogestagenic activity could also be demonstrated in several in vivo models. Furthermore, this compound displayed only marginal antiglucocorticoid effects. In tumor models ZK 230211 exhibited strong antiproliferative action. The pharmacological properties of ZK 230211 may prove useful in the treatment of endometriosis, leiomyomas, breast cancer, and in hormone replacement therapy.",Journal: J. Med.

In contrast to many other antiprogestins, ZK 230211 did not convert to an agonist in the presence of protein kinase A (PKA) activators and showed high antiprogestagenic activity on both PR isoforms PR-A and PR-B. This high antiprogestagenic activity could also be demonstrated in several in vivo models. Furthermore, this compound displayed only marginal antiglucocorticoid effects.

PR plays key roles in various physiological systems, including the female reproductive system, and PR antagonists are candidates for clinical treatment of multiple diseases, including uterine leiomyoma, endometriosis, breast cancer, and some psychiatric disorders. We found that the benzenesulfonanilide skeleton functions as a novel scaffold for PR antagonists, and we adopted 3-chlorobenzenesulfonyl derivative 20a as a lead compound for structural development. Among the synthesized compounds, 3-trifluoromethyl derivative 32 exhibited the most potent PR-antagonistic activity, with high binding affinity for PR and selectivity over androgen receptor (AR). It is structurally distinct from other nonsteroidal PR antagonists, including cyanopyrrole derivatives, and further modification is expected to afford novel selective PR modulators.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: ACS Med Chem Lett_||_Year: 2016_||_Volume: 7_||_Issue: 12_||_First Page: 1028_||_Last Page: 1033_||_DOI: 10.1021/acsmedchemlett.6b00184_||_Target ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL1871_||_ChEMBL Target Name: Androgen Receptor_||_ChEMBL Target Type: SINGLE PROTEIN - Target is a single protein chain_||_Relationship Type: D - Direct protein target assigned_||_Confidence: Direct single protein target assigned,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3867367,20180907,20220830,,,367,,P10275,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,27994732,0,,P10275,9606.0,45.0,,1.0,1.0,,,,antagonist,Androgen receptor,False,True,False,False

Radiochemical synthesis of these two species in high radiochemical purity and at high effective specific activity was accomplished by treatment of the corresponding diastereomerically pure 21-trifluoromethanesulfonates with fluorine-18 anion. In tissue biodistribution studies in estrogen-primed immature female Sprague-Dawley rats, both [18F]-endo-10a and [18F]endo-10b demonstrated high PR-selective uptake in the principal target tissues, the uterus and the ovaries, and relatively low uptake in fat and bone. The metabolism at the 21-position in these progestins (as monitored by in vivo defluorination) appears to be less than that in other 21-fluoroprogestins; this may reflect steric inhibition of metabolism at this site due to the bulk of the furan-substituted dioxolane ring at the 16 alpha, 17 alpha-position. Comparison with other fluorine-18-labeled progestins shows that the PR-specific uptake in uterine tissue correlates with the BSI of the ligand and that the fat uptake correlates with the NSB of the ligand at high levels of statistical significance.

Radiochemical synthesis of these two species in high radiochemical purity and at high effective specific activity was accomplished by treatment of the corresponding diastereomerically pure 21-trifluoromethanesulfonates with fluorine-18 anion. In tissue biodistribution studies in estrogen-primed immature female Sprague-Dawley rats, both [18F]-endo-10a and [18F]endo-10b demonstrated high PR-selective uptake in the principal target tissues, the uterus and the ovaries, and relatively low uptake in fat and bone. The metabolism at the 21-position in these progestins (as monitored by in vivo defluorination) appears to be less than that in other 21-fluoroprogestins; this may reflect steric inhibition of metabolism at this site due to the bulk of the furan-substituted dioxolane ring at the 16 alpha, 17 alpha-position.

Radiochemical synthesis of these two species in high radiochemical purity and at high effective specific activity was accomplished by treatment of the corresponding diastereomerically pure 21-trifluoromethanesulfonates with fluorine-18 anion. In tissue biodistribution studies in estrogen-primed immature female Sprague-Dawley rats, both [18F]-endo-10a and [18F]endo-10b demonstrated high PR-selective uptake in the principal target tissues, the uterus and the ovaries, and relatively low uptake in fat and bone.

Radiochemical synthesis of these two species in high radiochemical purity and at high effective specific activity was accomplished by treatment of the corresponding diastereomerically pure 21-trifluoromethanesulfonates with fluorine-18 anion. In tissue biodistribution studies in estrogen-primed immature female Sprague-Dawley rats, both [18F]-endo-10a and [18F]endo-10b demonstrated high PR-selective uptake in the principal target tissues, the uterus and the ovaries, and relatively low uptake in fat and bone.

Radiochemical synthesis of these two species in high radiochemical purity and at high effective specific activity was accomplished by treatment of the corresponding diastereomerically pure 21-trifluoromethanesulfonates with fluorine-18 anion. In tissue biodistribution studies in estrogen-primed immature female Sprague-Dawley rats, both [18F]-endo-10a and [18F]endo-10b demonstrated high PR-selective uptake in the principal target tissues, the uterus and the ovaries, and relatively low uptake in fat and bone.

Radiochemical synthesis of these two species in high radiochemical purity and at high effective specific activity was accomplished by treatment of the corresponding diastereomerically pure 21-trifluoromethanesulfonates with fluorine-18 anion. In tissue biodistribution studies in estrogen-primed immature female Sprague-Dawley rats, both [18F]-endo-10a and [18F]endo-10b demonstrated high PR-selective uptake in the principal target tissues, the uterus and the ovaries, and relatively low uptake in fat and bone. The metabolism at the 21-position in these progestins (as monitored by in vivo defluorination) appears to be less than that in other 21-fluoroprogestins; this may reflect steric inhibition of metabolism at this site due to the bulk of the furan-substituted dioxolane ring at the 16 alpha, 17 alpha-position. Comparison with other fluorine-18-labeled progestins shows that the PR-specific uptake in uterine tissue correlates with the BSI of the ligand and that the fat uptake correlates with the NSB of the ligand at high levels of statistical significance.

The introduction of a 17alpha-pentafluorethyl side chain in the D-ring of the steroid skeleton allowed the combination of high antiprogestagenic activity with little or no other endocrinological effects. In contrast to many other antiprogestins, ZK 230211 did not convert to an agonist in the presence of protein kinase A (PKA) activators and showed high antiprogestagenic activity on both PR isoforms PR-A and PR-B. This high antiprogestagenic activity could also be demonstrated in several in vivo models. Furthermore, this compound displayed only marginal antiglucocorticoid effects. In tumor models ZK 230211 exhibited strong antiproliferative action.

However, the steroidal structure of PR antagonists could bind to other hormone receptors, thus leading to serious side effects. On the other hand, non-steroidal PR antagonists have rarely been evaluated for their anti-cancer efficacy. Therefore, identifying novel non-steroidal PR antagonists possessing potent anti-cancer efficacy would be an attractive project to pursue. In this study, we presented a new metal-free oxidative CH arylation method to rapidly synthesize a series of 6-aryl-6H-benzo[c]chromene derivatives. Multiple cancer cell lines were used for their anti-cancer activity screening. An extensive analysis of structure-activity relationships (SAR) of the derivatives revealed that compounds 32 and 34 markedly inhibited the proliferation of MCF-7 cells with IC values of 6.32 ± 0.52 μM and 5.71 ± 0.49 μM, respectively. Further investigation indicated that derivatives 32 and 34 could elevate the expression of p21 and decrease the expressions of CDK4 and cyclin D1, leading to cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase. In addition, derivatives 32 and 34 could induce apoptosis of MCF-7 cells in both dose- and time-dependent manners by activation of p53 pathway, i.e., activation of Cleaved Caspase-3, p53 and P-p53 as well as elevation of the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. Docking of derivatives 32 and 34 into a PR homology model exhibited potent PR antagonistic activity indicating the 6-aryl-6H-benzo[c]chromene derivatives are promising PR antagonists. We envisioned that derivatives 32 and 34 might be potential anti-cancer drug candidates as novel therapeutic treatment for breast cancer.",Journal: Bioorg Med Chem_||_Year: 2021_||_Volume: 32_||_First Page: 116003_||_Last Page: 116003_||_DOI: 10.1016/j.bmc.2021.116003_||_Target ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL392_||_ChEMBL Target Name: A549_||_ChEMBL Target Type: CELL-LINE - Target is a specific cell-line_||_Relationship Type: N - Non-molecular target assigned_||_Confidence: Target assigned is non-molecular,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4689386,20220318,20220318,11975718|86088499|162643547|162643635|162644137|162645614|162645748|162646607|162646794|162648772|162648796|162650097|162653365|162654197|162655745|162659391|162660362|162662111|162668539|162670349|162672696|162677216,461515316|461515438|461516133|461518235|461518412|461519570|461519838|461522687|461522726|461524603|461527980|461529274|461530447|461532689|461537839|461539172|461541714|461550913|461552481|461553513|461556782|461563201,,,,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,33461148,0,,,,23.0,,22.0,,,Lung,,antagonist,A549,False,False,True,False

In addition, derivatives 32 and 34 could induce apoptosis of MCF-7 cells in both dose- and time-dependent manners by activation of p53 pathway, i.e., activation of Cleaved Caspase-3, p53 and P-p53 as well as elevation of the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio.

1511,39005,Confirmatory,binding affinity against human androgen receptor (har) in competitive binding assay,"Title: Homology modeling using multiple molecular dynamics simulations and docking studies of the human androgen receptor ligand binding domain bound to testosterone and nonsteroidal ligands._||_Abstract: To facilitate the rational design of novel and more potent androgen receptor ligands, three-dimensional models for the human androgen receptor ligand binding domain bound to testosterone have been developed. These models of the androgen receptor were based on the crystal structure of the highly homologous human progesterone receptor ligand binding domain. The homology modeled androgen receptor was refined using unrestrained multiple molecular dynamics simulations in explicit solvent. Key H-bonding partners with the 17-hydroxy group and 3-keto group of testosterone are Asn705 and Thr877, and Gln711 and Arg752, respectively. These models show the presence of a unique unoccupied cavity within the androgen receptor binding pocket which may be valuable in the development of novel selective androgen receptor ligands. A qualitative analysis of amino acid mutations within the hAR binding pocket that affect ligand binding are consistent with these androgen receptor models. In addition to testosterone, the binding modes of several hydroxyflutamide-like nonsteroidal ligands for the androgen receptor are investigated using flexible docking with FlexX followed by refinement of the initial complexes with molecular dynamics simulations. These docking studies indicate that Asn705 is an important determinant in binding hydroxyflutamide and its derivatives by participating in H-bond interactions with the alpha-hydroxy moiety of these ligands. In addition, the nitro functionality mimics the 3-keto group of the natural ligand testosterone and is involved in H-bonding interactions with Gln711 and Arg752. From these docking studies, we suggest a mechanism for the enantioselective binding of chiral hydroxyflutamide derivatives and expand upon the previously reported structure-activity relationship for hydroxyflutamide and its derivatives.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: J.

1536,1127668,Confirmatory,binding affinity to sigma-2 opioid receptor (unknown origin),"Title: The σ2 receptor: a novel protein for the imaging and treatment of cancer._||_Abstract: The σ2 receptor is an important target for the development of molecular probes in oncology because of its 10-fold higher density in proliferating tumor cells compared with that in quiescent tumor cells and because of the observation that σ2 receptor agonists are able to kill tumor cells via apoptotic and nonapoptotic mechanisms. Although recent evidence indicates that the σ2 receptor binding site is localized within the progesterone receptor membrane component 1 (PGRMC1), most information regarding this protein has been obtained using either radiolabeled or fluorescent receptor-based probes and from biochemical analysis of the effect of σ2 selective ligands on cells grown in culture. This article reviews the development of σ2 receptor ligands and presents an overview of how they have been used in vitro and in vivo to increase our understanding of the role of the σ2 receptor in cancer and proliferation.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: J.

Structure-activity relationship studies indicated that the shape and the structural bulkiness of the substituent at the 5-position of the isoxazole ring affected FXR-antagonistic activity. Compounds 15 g (5-substituent: 2-naphthyl) and 15 h (5-substituent: 4-biphenyl) were identified as potent antagonists with higher selectivity for FXR over progesterone receptor than the naturally occurring FXR antagonist GS. The 5-substituent is also a critical determinant of the characteristic corepressor recruitment profile of this class of FXR antagonists, though distinct mechanisms appear to be involved: 15 h stabilizes the corepressor-nuclear receptor interaction, while 15 g inhibits coactivator recruitment.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: Bioorg.

Development of dual selective estrogen receptor modulators/VEGFR-2 inhibitors (SERMs/V-2I) has been an attractive strategy for the discovery of new breast cancer therapeutic agents. Our previous efforts led to the preparation of a series of 3-aryl-4-anilino-2H-chromen-2-ones endowed with potent estrogen receptor binding affinity and anti-proliferative efficacy. In this study, various structurally related 3-aryl-4-anilino/aryloxy-2H-chromen-2-one analogues were rationally designed, synthesized and evaluated as a new chemo-type of dual ERα and VEGFR-2 inhibitors. Most of the derivatives exhibited potent activities in both enzymatic and cellular assays. SAR investigation revealed that introducing of bioisosteric O atom at the C-4 position of coumarin scaffold is beneficial to improve the inhibitory potency, especially in ERα binding affinity assay. Furthermore, most of the piperidyl substituted compounds showed better inhibitory activity against MCF-7 and Ishikawa cells than lead compounds BL-18d, tamoxifen and Vandetanib. Optimization of the hit compound, identified in an ERα binding affinity assay, led to compound 42d, exhibiting an IC50 for ERα binding affinity of 2.19 μM while retaining an excellent inhibition on VGFR-2 as well as a potent suppression on the growth of angiogenesis-related cells. In RT-PCR assay, 42d exerted significantly antiestrogenic property via suppressing the expression of progesterone receptor (PgR) mRNA in MCF-7 cells, which was consistent with the ERα antagonistic property of a selective estrogen receptor modulator. Further mechanism investigation demonstrated that compound 42d could inhibit the activation of VEGFR-2 and subsequent signaling transduction of Raf-1/MAPK/ERK pathway in MCF-7 cells.

The synthesis proceeds in two steps from 21-hydroxy-16 alpha-ethyl-19-norprogesterone and involves [18F]fluoride ion displacement of the 21-trifluoromethanesulfonate (21-triflate). This material is purified by HPLC and is obtained in 4-30% overall yield (decay corrected) within 40 min after the end of bombardment to produce [18F]fluoride ion. The effective specific activity, determined by competitive radioreceptor binding assays, is 700-1400 Ci/mmol. In vivo, [18F]FENP demonstrates highly selective, receptor-mediated uptake by the uterus of estrogen-primed rats; the uterus to blood and uterus to muscle ratios were respectively 26 and 16 at 1 h and 71 and 41 at 3 h after injection. The high target tissue selectivity of this uptake suggests that this compound may be useful for the in vivo imaging of progestin target tissues and receptor-rich tumors (such as human breast tumors) by positron emission tomography.",Journal: J.

Prolonged LBP-targeting leads to resistance, and alternative therapies are urgently required. We report the identification and characterization of a novel series of diarylhydrazides as selective disruptors of AR interaction with coactivators through application of structure and ligand-based virtual screening. Compounds demonstrate full ('true') antagonism in AR with low micromolar potency, selectivity over estrogen receptors α and β and glucocorticoid receptor, and partial antagonism of the progesterone receptor.

Focusing on the similarity of the GR and progesterone receptor (PR) ligand-binding domain (LBD) structures, we adopted our recently developed PR antagonist 10 as a lead compound and synthesized a series of derivatives. We found that the N-(4-phenoxyphenyl)benzenesulfonamide skeleton serves as a versatile scaffold for GR antagonists. Among them, 4-cyano derivative 14m was the most potent, with an IC50 value of 1.43μM for GR. This compound showed good selectivity for GR; it retained relatively weak antagonistic activity toward PR (IC50 for PR: 8.00μM; 250-fold less potent than 10), but showed no activity toward AR, ERα or ERβ. Interestingly, the 4-amino derivative 15a exhibited transrepression activity toward NF-κB in addition to GR-antagonistic activity, whereas 14m did not. The structure-activity relationship for transrepression was different from that for GR-antagonistic activity. Computational docking simulations suggested that 15a might bind to the ligand-binding pocket of GR in a different manner from 14m. These findings open up new possibilities for developing novel nonsteroidal GR modulators with distinctive activity profiles.",Journal: Bioorg Med Chem_||_Year: 2017_||_Volume: 25_||_Issue: 13_||_First Page: 3461_||_Last Page: 3470_||_DOI: 10.1016/j.bmc.2017.04.032_||_Target ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL242_||_ChEMBL Target Name: Estrogen receptor beta_||_ChEMBL Target Type: SINGLE PROTEIN - Target is a single protein chain_||_Relationship Type: D - Direct protein target assigned_||_Confidence: Direct single protein target assigned,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4035635,20200621,20220318,132502971,381871512,2100,,Q92731,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,28506584,0,,Q92731,9606.0,45.0,,1.0,,,,,antagonist,Estrogen receptor beta,False,False,False,False

Development of dual selective estrogen receptor modulators/VEGFR-2 inhibitors (SERMs/V-2I) has been an attractive strategy for the discovery of new breast cancer therapeutic agents. Our previous efforts led to the preparation of a series of 3-aryl-4-anilino-2H-chromen-2-ones endowed with potent estrogen receptor binding affinity and anti-proliferative efficacy. In this study, various structurally related 3-aryl-4-anilino/aryloxy-2H-chromen-2-one analogues were rationally designed, synthesized and evaluated as a new chemo-type of dual ERα and VEGFR-2 inhibitors. Most of the derivatives exhibited potent activities in both enzymatic and cellular assays. SAR investigation revealed that introducing of bioisosteric O atom at the C-4 position of coumarin scaffold is beneficial to improve the inhibitory potency, especially in ERα binding affinity assay. Furthermore, most of the piperidyl substituted compounds showed better inhibitory activity against MCF-7 and Ishikawa cells than lead compounds BL-18d, tamoxifen and Vandetanib. Optimization of the hit compound, identified in an ERα binding affinity assay, led to compound 42d, exhibiting an IC50 for ERα binding affinity of 2.19 μM while retaining an excellent inhibition on VGFR-2 as well as a potent suppression on the growth of angiogenesis-related cells. In RT-PCR assay, 42d exerted significantly antiestrogenic property via suppressing the expression of progesterone receptor (PgR) mRNA in MCF-7 cells, which was consistent with the ERα antagonistic property of a selective estrogen receptor modulator.

Optimization of the hit compound, identified in an ERα binding affinity assay, led to compound 42d, exhibiting an IC50 for ERα binding affinity of 2.19 μM while retaining an excellent inhibition on VGFR-2 as well as a potent suppression on the growth of angiogenesis-related cells. In RT-PCR assay, 42d exerted significantly antiestrogenic property via suppressing the expression of progesterone receptor (PgR) mRNA in MCF-7 cells, which was consistent with the ERα antagonistic property of a selective estrogen receptor modulator. Further mechanism investigation demonstrated that compound 42d could inhibit the activation of VEGFR-2 and subsequent signaling transduction of Raf-1/MAPK/ERK pathway in MCF-7 cells.

Focusing on the similarity of the GR and progesterone receptor (PR) ligand-binding domain (LBD) structures, we adopted our recently developed PR antagonist 10 as a lead compound and synthesized a series of derivatives. We found that the N-(4-phenoxyphenyl)benzenesulfonamide skeleton serves as a versatile scaffold for GR antagonists. Among them, 4-cyano derivative 14m was the most potent, with an IC50 value of 1.43μM for GR. This compound showed good selectivity for GR; it retained relatively weak antagonistic activity toward PR (IC50 for PR: 8.00μM; 250-fold less potent than 10), but showed no activity toward AR, ERα or ERβ. Interestingly, the 4-amino derivative 15a exhibited transrepression activity toward NF-κB in addition to GR-antagonistic activity, whereas 14m did not. The structure-activity relationship for transrepression was different from that for GR-antagonistic activity. Computational docking simulations suggested that 15a might bind to the ligand-binding pocket of GR in a different manner from 14m. These findings open up new possibilities for developing novel nonsteroidal GR modulators with distinctive activity profiles.",Journal: Bioorg Med Chem_||_Year: 2017_||_Volume: 25_||_Issue: 13_||_First Page: 3461_||_Last Page: 3470_||_DOI: 10.1016/j.bmc.2017.04.032_||_Target ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL206_||_ChEMBL Target Name: Estrogen receptor alpha_||_ChEMBL Target Type: SINGLE PROTEIN - Target is a single protein chain_||_Relationship Type: D - Direct protein target assigned_||_Confidence: Direct single protein target assigned,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4035634,20200621,20220318,132502971,381871512,2099,,P03372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,28506584,0,,P03372,9606.0,45.0,,1.0,,,,,antagonist,Estrogen receptor,False,False,False,False

Development of dual selective estrogen receptor modulators/VEGFR-2 inhibitors (SERMs/V-2I) has been an attractive strategy for the discovery of new breast cancer therapeutic agents. Our previous efforts led to the preparation of a series of 3-aryl-4-anilino-2H-chromen-2-ones endowed with potent estrogen receptor binding affinity and anti-proliferative efficacy. In this study, various structurally related 3-aryl-4-anilino/aryloxy-2H-chromen-2-one analogues were rationally designed, synthesized and evaluated as a new chemo-type of dual ERα and VEGFR-2 inhibitors. Most of the derivatives exhibited potent activities in both enzymatic and cellular assays. SAR investigation revealed that introducing of bioisosteric O atom at the C-4 position of coumarin scaffold is beneficial to improve the inhibitory potency, especially in ERα binding affinity assay. Furthermore, most of the piperidyl substituted compounds showed better inhibitory activity against MCF-7 and Ishikawa cells than lead compounds BL-18d, tamoxifen and Vandetanib. Optimization of the hit compound, identified in an ERα binding affinity assay, led to compound 42d, exhibiting an IC50 for ERα binding affinity of 2.19 μM while retaining an excellent inhibition on VGFR-2 as well as a potent suppression on the growth of angiogenesis-related cells. In RT-PCR assay, 42d exerted significantly antiestrogenic property via suppressing the expression of progesterone receptor (PgR) mRNA in MCF-7 cells, which was consistent with the ERα antagonistic property of a selective estrogen receptor modulator. Further mechanism investigation demonstrated that compound 42d could inhibit the activation of VEGFR-2 and subsequent signaling transduction of Raf-1/MAPK/ERK pathway in MCF-7 cells.

In this study, various structurally related 3-aryl-4-anilino/aryloxy-2H-chromen-2-one analogues were rationally designed, synthesized and evaluated as a new chemo-type of dual ERα and VEGFR-2 inhibitors. Most of the derivatives exhibited potent activities in both enzymatic and cellular assays. SAR investigation revealed that introducing of bioisosteric O atom at the C-4 position of coumarin scaffold is beneficial to improve the inhibitory potency, especially in ERα binding affinity assay. Furthermore, most of the piperidyl substituted compounds showed better inhibitory activity against MCF-7 and Ishikawa cells than lead compounds BL-18d, tamoxifen and Vandetanib. Optimization of the hit compound, identified in an ERα binding affinity assay, led to compound 42d, exhibiting an IC50 for ERα binding affinity of 2.19 μM while retaining an excellent inhibition on VGFR-2 as well as a potent suppression on the growth of angiogenesis-related cells. In RT-PCR assay, 42d exerted significantly antiestrogenic property via suppressing the expression of progesterone receptor (PgR) mRNA in MCF-7 cells, which was consistent with the ERα antagonistic property of a selective estrogen receptor modulator. Further mechanism investigation demonstrated that compound 42d could inhibit the activation of VEGFR-2 and subsequent signaling transduction of Raf-1/MAPK/ERK pathway in MCF-7 cells.

To discover selective glucocorticoid receptor modulators (SGRMs) that preferentially induce transrepression with little or no transactivation activity, a structure-based virtual screening by combining molecular docking and InteractionGraphNet (IGN) rescoring was performed, and compound HP210 was identified. HP210 did not induce the transactivation functions of GR while still acted on the NF-κB mediated tethered transrepression function (IC<sub>50</sub> = 2.32 μM), and suppressed the secretion of pro-inflammation cytokines IL-1β and IL-6. Compared with dexamethasone, HP210 showed no cross activities with phylogenetically related mineralcorticoid receptor and progesterone receptor and no significant effect on osteoprotegerin, exhibiting a reduced side-effect profile. Then, guided by the molecular dynamics simulations and binding free energy calculations, compound HP210_b4 with over two-fold higher transrepression activity (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.99 μM) was discovered.

1764,624158,Summary,qhts assay to identify small molecule activators of brca1 expression: summary,"Functionally, BRCA1 has been implicated in a wide array of cellular activities, including DNA damage repair, cell-cycle checkpoint control, growth inhibition, apoptosis, transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodeling, protein ubiquitylation, and mammary stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. Reduction in BRCA1 levels is associated with an increase in tumor growth and resistance to anti-estrogenic agents, such as tamoxifen, while an increase in BRCA1 expression leads to cell growth arrest and apoptosis. Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo studies have revealed that loss of BRCA1 expression in mammary epithelial cells leads to failure of terminal luminal epithelial cell differentiation, exaggerated expression of basal/myoepithelial antigens, and enrichment of cells with expression of the putative stem/progenitor cell marker ALDH1A1. The frequent loss of BRCA1 expression in invasive breast cancers in the absence of somatic mutation has been attributed to numerous mechanisms, including hypermethylation of the BRCA1 promoter, exaggerated ubiquitylation of BRCA1 protein, and improper intracellular localization. Transcriptional profiling of large cohorts of BRCA1-mutated breast cancers has revealed that these tumors, almost without exception, cluster in the basal-like subtype. Like breast tumors which arise in BRCA1 mutation carriers, sporadic cancers which demonstrate somatic silencing or dysfunction of BRCA1 are also of the basal-like phenotype [25, 26]. Basal-like breast cancers (BLBCs) are associated with an aggressive clinical course, resistance to chemotherapy, and typically lack expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). BLBCs account for 10-17% of all breast cancers, have few therapeutic options, and are considered the biggest unmet need in the treatment of breast cancer. Conversely, tumors which maintain expression of functional BRCA1 are almost uniformly luminal type cancers, and are accordingly associated with more indolent clinical courses, responsiveness to endocrine therapies, and improved survival. _||_As such, it is possible that an increase in BRCA1 expression would enable cellular differentiation and restore tumor suppressor function, resulting in delayed tumor growth and less aggressive, more treatable breast cancers. The long term goal of this proposal is to develop a novel prevention or therapeutic agent for breast cancer patients. To accomplish this goal, the overall objective of this proposal is to access the resources provided by the NIH Molecular Libraries Roadmap Initiative and the Molecular Libraries Probe Production Centers Network (MLPCN) to discover and develop new chemical activator probes that will increase BRCA1 expression and function._||_NIH Molecular Libraries Probe Production Network [MLPCN]_||_NIH Chemical Genomics Center [NCGC]_||_Grant: MH093215_||_PI Name: Lisa Harlan-Williams, University of Kansas Medical Center",This project is on-going and will be updated at a later point.,2,National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS),BRCA1000,20120522,20120525,,,672,,AAC37594,Governmental Organizations|NIH Initiatives,15546503,0,,P38398,9606.0,,,,,,,,unknown,BRCA1 [Homo sapiens],False,False,True,False

A series of methoxy-substituted biisoquinoline compounds have been synthesized as a potential chemotherapeutic agent for the triple-negative breast cancers which are especially challenging to manage. Structure activity relationship study revealed that rigid 6,6'-dimethoxy biisoquinoline imidazolium compound (1c, DH20931) exhibited the significant growth inhibitory effects on both triple-positive and triple-negative human breast cancer cell lines with IC50 in the range of 0.3-3.9 μM.

1829,1453295,Literature-derived,antagonist activity at human ar expressed in hek293 cells at 30 um after 24 hrs by luciferase reporter gene assay,"Title: Development of nonsteroidal glucocorticoid receptor modulators based on N-benzyl-N-(4-phenoxyphenyl)benzenesulfonamide scaffold._||_Abstract: N-Benzyl-N-(4-phenoxyphenyl)benzenesulfonamide derivatives were developed as a novel class of nonsteroidal glucocorticoid receptor (GR) modulators, which are promising drug candidates for treating immune-related disorders. Focusing on the similarity of the GR and progesterone receptor (PR) ligand-binding domain (LBD) structures, we adopted our recently developed PR antagonist 10 as a lead compound and synthesized a series of derivatives. We found that the N-(4-phenoxyphenyl)benzenesulfonamide skeleton serves as a versatile scaffold for GR antagonists. Among them, 4-cyano derivative 14m was the most potent, with an IC50 value of 1.43μM for GR. This compound showed good selectivity for GR; it retained relatively weak antagonistic activity toward PR (IC50 for PR: 8.00μM; 250-fold less potent than 10), but showed no activity toward AR, ERα or ERβ. Interestingly, the 4-amino derivative 15a exhibited transrepression activity toward NF-κB in addition to GR-antagonistic activity, whereas 14m did not. The structure-activity relationship for transrepression was different from that for GR-antagonistic activity. Computational docking simulations suggested that 15a might bind to the ligand-binding pocket of GR in a different manner from 14m. These findings open up new possibilities for developing novel nonsteroidal GR modulators with distinctive activity profiles.",Journal: Bioorg Med Chem_||_Year: 2017_||_Volume: 25_||_Issue: 13_||_First Page: 3461_||_Last Page: 3470_||_DOI: 10.1016/j.bmc.2017.04.032_||_Target ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL1871_||_ChEMBL Target Name: Androgen Receptor_||_ChEMBL Target Type: SINGLE PROTEIN - Target is a single protein chain_||_Relationship Type: D - Direct protein target assigned_||_Confidence: Direct single protein target assigned,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4035633,20200621,20220318,132502971,381871512,367,,P10275,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,28506584,0,,P10275,9606.0,45.0,,1.0,,,,,antagonist,Androgen receptor,False,False,False,False

The structures of the isolated compounds were determined on the basis of one- and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy and high-resolution mass spectrometry as well as by comparison with the literature. All compounds were tested for their activity towards the Hsp90 chaperoning machine in vitro using the progesterone receptor (PR) and rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL). Among the isolated compounds, only sclerotiorin efficiently inhibited the Hsp90 machine chaperoning activity. However, sclerotiorin showed no cytotoxic effect on breast cancer Hs578T, MDA-MB-231 and prostate cancer LNCaP cell lines.

Here a series of 2, 4-disubstituted pyrimidine derivatives were designed, synthesized and evaluated as dual ERα/VEGFR-2 ligands. Most of the derivatives exhibited potent activities in both enzymatic and cellular assays. Structure-activity relationship studies showed that a hydrogen-bonding interaction in the head section is important factors for the enhancement of ERα-binding affinity.

Extensive investigation of mechanisms of action indicated that 7h inhibits autophagic flux and sequential accumulation of p62, leading to DNA damage and disrepair in TNBC cells. Importantly, nuclear p62 accumulation induced by compound 7h results in the inhibition of RNF168-mediated chromatin ubiquitination and the degradation of HR-related proteins in regulating the DNA damage response (DDR) process. In in vivo studies, compound 7h completely suppressed tumor growth in the MDA-MB-231 xenograft model at a dose of 15 mg/kg/q.d.

Through a medium throughput screening and iterative medicinal chemistry optimization, we identified compound 7h as an autophagic flux inhibitor, which showed potent activities against human TNBC (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468) cell lines with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 8.3 μM, and 6.0 μM, respectively, which are comparable to the potency of 5-FU and Cisplatin, the first line therapies for TNBC. Extensive investigation of mechanisms of action indicated that 7h inhibits autophagic flux and sequential accumulation of p62, leading to DNA damage and disrepair in TNBC cells. Importantly, nuclear p62 accumulation induced by compound 7h results in the inhibition of RNF168-mediated chromatin ubiquitination and the degradation of HR-related proteins in regulating the DNA damage response (DDR) process. In in vivo studies, compound 7h completely suppressed tumor growth in the MDA-MB-231 xenograft model at a dose of 15 mg/kg/q.d.

Extensive investigation of mechanisms of action indicated that 7h inhibits autophagic flux and sequential accumulation of p62, leading to DNA damage and disrepair in TNBC cells. Importantly, nuclear p62 accumulation induced by compound 7h results in the inhibition of RNF168-mediated chromatin ubiquitination and the degradation of HR-related proteins in regulating the DNA damage response (DDR) process. In in vivo studies, compound 7h completely suppressed tumor growth in the MDA-MB-231 xenograft model at a dose of 15 mg/kg/q.d.

Importantly, nuclear p62 accumulation induced by compound 7h results in the inhibition of RNF168-mediated chromatin ubiquitination and the degradation of HR-related proteins in regulating the DNA damage response (DDR) process. In in vivo studies, compound 7h completely suppressed tumor growth in the MDA-MB-231 xenograft model at a dose of 15 mg/kg/q.d.

Through a medium throughput screening and iterative medicinal chemistry optimization, we identified compound 7h as an autophagic flux inhibitor, which showed potent activities against human TNBC (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468) cell lines with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 8.3 μM, and 6.0 μM, respectively, which are comparable to the potency of 5-FU and Cisplatin, the first line therapies for TNBC. Extensive investigation of mechanisms of action indicated that 7h inhibits autophagic flux and sequential accumulation of p62, leading to DNA damage and disrepair in TNBC cells. Importantly, nuclear p62 accumulation induced by compound 7h results in the inhibition of RNF168-mediated chromatin ubiquitination and the degradation of HR-related proteins in regulating the DNA damage response (DDR) process. In in vivo studies, compound 7h completely suppressed tumor growth in the MDA-MB-231 xenograft model at a dose of 15 mg/kg/q.d.

Through a medium throughput screening and iterative medicinal chemistry optimization, we identified compound 7h as an autophagic flux inhibitor, which showed potent activities against human TNBC (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468) cell lines with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 8.3 μM, and 6.0 μM, respectively, which are comparable to the potency of 5-FU and Cisplatin, the first line therapies for TNBC. Extensive investigation of mechanisms of action indicated that 7h inhibits autophagic flux and sequential accumulation of p62, leading to DNA damage and disrepair in TNBC cells. Importantly, nuclear p62 accumulation induced by compound 7h results in the inhibition of RNF168-mediated chromatin ubiquitination and the degradation of HR-related proteins in regulating the DNA damage response (DDR) process. In in vivo studies, compound 7h completely suppressed tumor growth in the MDA-MB-231 xenograft model at a dose of 15 mg/kg/q.d.

Here a series of 2, 4-disubstituted pyrimidine derivatives were designed, synthesized and evaluated as dual ERα/VEGFR-2 ligands. Most of the derivatives exhibited potent activities in both enzymatic and cellular assays. Structure-activity relationship studies showed that a hydrogen-bonding interaction in the head section is important factors for the enhancement of ERα-binding affinity. The most potent compound II-9OH, an analog of 2-(4-hydroxylphenyl)pyrimidine, was 19-fold more efficacious than tamoxifen in MCF-7 cancer cells and exhibited the best ERα binding affinity (IC50 = 1.64 μM) as well as excellent VEGFR-2 inhibition (IC50 = 0.085 μM). Furthermore, this dual targeted compound II-9OH exerted significantly antiestrogenic property via suppressing the expression of progesterone receptor (PgR) mRNA in MCF-7 cells and also showed obvious in vivo angiogenesis inhibitory effects in CAM assay. An induction of apoptosis and a decrease in cell migration, accompanied by transduction inhibition of Raf-1/MAPK/ERK pathway, were observed in MCF-7 cells after treatment with II-9OH, suggesting that II-9OH is a promising candidate for the development of multifunctional agents targeting ERα and VEGFR-2 in the therapy of some breast cancers.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: Eur J Med Chem_||_Year: 2018_||_Volume: 150_||_First Page: 783_||_Last Page: 795_||_DOI: 10.1016/j.ejmech.2018.03.018_||_Target ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL387_||_ChEMBL Target Name: MCF7_||_ChEMBL Target Type: CELL-LINE - Target is a specific cell-line_||_Relationship Type: N - Non-molecular target assigned_||_Confidence: Target assigned is non-molecular,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4231540,20200619,20220830,5035|2733526|145982555|145982571|145982754|145983278|145983465|145983816|145983975|145984124|145984234|145984412|145984478|145984530|145984791|145985051|145985090|145985325|145985468|145985540|145985802|145985942|145986257,103170049|103170100|404700961|404700983|404701245|404701984|404702248|404702734|404702954|404703163|404703322|404703589|404703676|404703748|404704108|404704443|404704506|404704842|404705053|404705160|404705536|404705737|404706184,,,,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,29587221,0,,,,31.0,,23.0,5.0,,,,unknown,MCF7,False,True,True,False

Polypharmacology is commonly observed, requiring thorough target deconvolution to understand drug mechanism of action. Using chemical proteomics, we analyzed the target spectrum of 243 clinically evaluated kinase drugs. The data revealed previously unknown targets for established drugs, offered a perspective on the 'druggable' kinome, highlighted (non)kinase off-targets, and suggested potential therapeutic applications. Integration of phosphoproteomic data refined drug-affected pathways, identified response markers, and strengthened rationale for combination treatments. We exemplify translational value by discovering SIK2 (salt-inducible kinase 2) inhibitors that modulate cytokine production in primary cells, by identifying drugs against the lung cancer survival marker MELK (maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase), and by repurposing cabozantinib to treat FLT3-ITD-positive acute myeloid leukemia. This resource, available via the ProteomicsDB database, should facilitate basic, clinical, and drug discovery research and aid clinical decision-making.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: Science_||_Year: 2017_||_Volume: 358_||_Issue: 6367_||_DOI: 10.1126/science.aan4368_||_Target ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL4105706_||_ChEMBL Target Name: Membrane-associated progesterone receptor component 1_||_ChEMBL Target Type: SINGLE PROTEIN - Target is a single protein chain_||_Relationship Type: D - Direct protein target assigned_||_Confidence: Direct single protein target assigned_||_Data Source: Kuster lab chemical proteomics drug profiling,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3991822,20200620,20230314,3794|5291|43860|72435|148177|151194|156414|208908|216239|644241|3025986|3035817|3062316|3064778|3081361|5081913|5328940|5329099|5329102|5330286|5494449|6420138|6444692|6445562|6918289|9806229|9808844|9811611|9823820|9826528|9863672|9868037|9871074|9874913|9911830|9915743|9926791|10074640|10090485|10113978|10127622|10138259|10184653|10288191|10341154|10430360|10458325|10461508|11152667|11167602|11213558|11282283|11285002|11313622|11338033|11364421|11387605|11427553|11485656|11488320|11494412|11497983|11520894|11548630|11620908|11625818|11626560|11640390|11656518|11667893|11671467|11707110|11712625|11712649|11713159|11719003|11955855|11977753|11978790|15604510|15983966|16007391|16041424|16118392|16123056|16124208|16222096|16654980|16659841|16666708|16718576|16719221|16722836|16725726|16739650|16747683|17754438|22024915|22049997|23582824|23635314|23653175|24748204|24748573|24756910|24765037|24771867|24779724|24856041|24856436|24864821|24889392|24905401|24963252|24964624|24993189|24995524|25031915|25033539|25062766|25102847|25117126|25118925|25141092|25151352|25161177|25167777|25171648|25181472|25227462|25254071|25262792|25262965|42611257|42642645|42642648|44137675|44137946|44187362|44205240|44462760|44516953|44603533|44631912|45142457|45270897|46191454|46239015|46843057|46911863|46926350|49803313|49830590|49831257|50922675|50922691|51039094|51042438|56649450|56846693|56949517|56960447|56960607|57430866|58423153|59422203|66555680|68289010|71496458|71727581|89455219|117606729|135398495|135398510|135398516|135567102|135984730|136662663,103175695|103175813|103177479|103192207|103194628|103196306|103202250|103220856|103229612|103245522|103317292|103420820|103441767|103461613|103470071|103482046|103501621|103502389|103502395|103506979|103510213|103554447|103561898|103563888|103565670|103568709|103573134|103588661|103589138|103589409|103596121|103604655|103620793|103623548|103624610|103627919|103628628|103631444|103641275|103643679|103651972|103652037|103652038|103667735|103685839|103688417|103694305|103694307|103699058|103705703|103722311|103728028|103729562|103730344|103741972|103743167|103744977|103744991|103749228|103751467|103756518|103768626|103771165|104245715|104246358|104246799|104246801|104247312|104249468|104249696|104250512|104252247|104253094|123085234|123085249|123087413|123089189|123092438|123098996|123101372|124963590|124973404|131277755|134434312|134448064|136920478|136922080|136923474|136925373|136933680|136936437|136937804|136944791|160667665|160676622|160680893|160681714|160681716|160682577|160683809|160692470|160692473|160699332|160701269|160703522|160706048|160707851|160708509|160708511|160708513|160709020|163312449|163315619|163320808|163323209|163333081|164141653|164148325|164149381|174486688|174500821|174507796|174510191|174522081|174525691|174525694|194153747|194161621|194168287|194175385|242405914|242514641|242521328|242521480|242553396|242558147|242559915|242566533|242585457|242585634|242587692|242590736|242591564|242613214|242637241|242651807|242651812|242651822|312358004|312364436|312367127|312382539|312393544|312467782|312467794|312467810|312467814|312467816|312467833|312467926|312467933|312467960|312467987|312468007|312468065|312468157|312468216|318377089|318457805|336907714|374263426|374263626|374270483|381834807|381835695|381836756|381836757|381841290|381891965,10857,,O00264,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,29191878,0,,O00264,9606.0,,,179.0,1.0,,,,unknown,Membrane-associated progesterone receptor component 1,False,True,False,False
